            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Active,</hi> and <hi>Passive</hi> Justification, or <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification</hi> Actively, and Passively taken, are not two things, or two distinct <hi>species,</hi> or kinds of Justification, but one, and the same, diversly considered, or under distinct respects, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitudes. As the love wherewith I love another man, and the love wherewith he is belov'd of me, are one and the same, but may be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered either as in me, as the <hi>Subject</hi> of that love, or as terminated upon him as the <hi>Object.</hi>

               <p>Though <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Passive</hi> Justification do admit of a distinct consideration, yet they can never be really separated, or apart, or one without the other. For God can never be said to justifie, but when some body is Justified by him, for every Action must have an Object, and every Agent, a Patient. Therefore that justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication from Eternity which some speak of, is only God's Decree to justifie such and such in time, <hi>viz.</hi> when they should come to believe in Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. <hi>And the Scripture fore-see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God would justifie the Gentiles through Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet notwithstanding Justification Active and Passive are the same thing (only considered the first as coming from God, and the latter as received or applyed by the Believer) neither can they be separated, yet this distinction hath it's use. For when we say Faith is an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our <hi>Justification</hi> it is not as Justification is <hi>Actively</hi> considered; for how can any Action of Man be an Instrument to God's Action? But as we are Passively justified we are <hi>justified by believing;</hi> it's not our faith that doth produce our Justification properly; Therefore when it is said, that only <hi>Faith justifieth,</hi> it is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved Passively. By Faith only we are justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

                  <hi>Justification</hi> (to give you the definition of it) is a gracious Act, or Sentence of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by every true Believer is acquitted, discharged, and absolved, of, and from his sins, and is accounted, declared, and pronunced just, and righteous only for the Righteousness, or Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Christ imputed to him, and received by Faith alone. <hi>Vide Ames. p.</hi> 115.

               <p>Justification is rightly called an Act of God's <hi>Free Grace,</hi> and Mercy (or a gracious Act of God) (though there be full Satisfaction in the case) upon several accounts. As namely, 1. Because God accepteth of the obedience of one for another, of Christ for us, which he might have chosen whether he would have done, for he might have insisted upon Satisfaction from the Person offending. God might have said, that <hi>The very Soul which hath sinned it shall dye.</hi> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the Superiors of <hi>Zaleucus</hi> (had he had any) might have chosen whether they would have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of one of his Eyes, instead of one of his Sons, who had forfeited both. 2. God in strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Justice might have required the <hi>idem,</hi> the self-same satisfaction which the Law required, or <hi>penalty</hi> which the Law threatned, <hi>viz.</hi> the eternal destruction of Sinners: but he has been pleased to accept of the <hi>tantundem,</hi> or <hi>tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount,</hi> from Christ, which is as if a Man were bound to pay me 1000 <hi>l.</hi> in Lawful money of <hi>England,</hi> and I should accept of a <hi>Jewel,</hi> one, or more, to that value, instead thereof, which every body knows I was not bound to do, or might refuse. But 3. It was yet a far greater Act of Grace than either of the former, for God to provide, and procure a Surety, and a Satisfaction, at his own Cost, and Charges (as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:212643:6"/>

               <p>The definition of Justification which we have given, containeth also the <hi>Material Cause</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>viz.</hi> the Righteousness, or Obedience of Christ: which may otherwise be called the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cause,</hi> or the <hi>Procatarctical,</hi> or external moving cause thereof. For when a <hi>material cause</hi> is assigned of things that are immaterial, or spiritual, the word <hi>matter,</hi> or material, must needs be taken in a <hi>moral,</hi> or <hi>spiritual</hi> sense, and not in a strict sense, for <hi>matter</hi> properly so called.</p>

Christ justifieth as an <hi>Advocate,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1, 2. alledging his own Obedience in our stead for our justification. 3. The <hi>Law</hi> is said to justifie, because it is the <hi>Rule</hi> by which the Judge proceeds in justification, <hi>John</hi> 7.51. 4. <hi>Witnesses</hi> are said to justifie, when their evidence helps to clear the party accused. In that sense Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is said to excuse, or justifie, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.20, 21. 5. Whatsoever is pleaded as a sufficient ground, or motive, for which a Man may be cleared from the fault objected against him is said to <hi>justifie.</hi> So <hi>works</hi> justifie, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.22.24.

To which the Answer is, It is by means of the Righteousness of Christ imputed to them, and by means of that imputation, made as bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to them, as if it were formally inherent in them. Now the Definition given doth also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>formal cause</hi> of our Justification, <hi>viz.</hi> the imputation of Christs Righteousness, or Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to us.

               <p>The benefit of Christ's imputed Righteousness doth not consist in this, that thereby we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with an inherent Righteousness which may abide the strict judgment of God; but that apprehending Christ by Faith, with respect to his Merits, we may be absolved from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning power of the Law, and accepted to life eternal. <hi>Ergo,</hi> For this he quotes <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. and

               <p>The last Argument of the Excellent Bishop afore-said proving the <hi>Imputation</hi> of Christ his Righteousness to be the <hi>Formal Cause</hi> of our Justification, is as followeth.</p>

But this is in plain words Asserted by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>For as by the offence of one Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came upon all men to condemnation: even so by the Righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men to Justification of life.</hi>

               <p>He that is formally justified by Inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, from the time he he hath attained that quality is acceptable to God, and worthy of eternal life by vertue of that quality, without the supervening Grace of God, and Imputation of the Merits of Christ.

For if it be enquired, how we come to be received as the Children of God, the Scripture answereth, by, and for Christ: not by, and for the Sanctity that is bestowed upon us. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>God sent his Son

               <p>The Formal cause of Justification ought to be such, as to which a Believer may safely, and boldly commit himself in trouble of Conscience, and in the Agony of Death.

               <p>If the Righteousness of Christ be the <hi>Matter,</hi> or <hi>Material</hi> cause of Justification, then the <hi>Imputation</hi> thereof is the <hi>Form,</hi> or <hi>Formal</hi> cause thereof.

By the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of our Justification, I mean that Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by which we are justified; I say if it be so, then <hi>Imputation,</hi> or the <hi>Imputing</hi> of that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness must be the <hi>Forme:</hi> For it is the way, and manner in which we are justified, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Righteousness of Christ comes to be as useful to us, for matter of Justification; as if it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:212643:17"/> an internal, inherently formal Righteousness, which were in strictness of speaking, that form whereby we were made just, or Righteous. Now that the Righteousness of Christ is the <hi>Material Cause</hi> of our Justification, I prove by the ensuing Arguments</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Righteousness whereby we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied is God's Righteousness, not ours, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21. The Righteousness of Christ which is out of us in him is God's Righteousness, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. that which is inherent in us is ours: therefore we are justified by the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ, which is out of us in him, and not by that which is inherent in our selves. Now in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3. There is such an opposition made betwixt God's Righteousness and ours, in the point of Justification; that whosoever seek to be justified by their own Righteousness, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be justified by the Righteousness of God. Bp. <hi>D.</hi> p. 127, 128.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That is the <hi>matter</hi> of our Justification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, by which we being sinners in our selves do stand righteous before God, which we being sinners may oppose to the Judgment of God, why he should not condemn us, which we may plead as a full satisfaction to God for us: such is the Righteousness of Christ. For being sinners in our selves, yet believing in Christ, we are in him accepted, and constituted Righteous, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By that Righteousness of man which only is <hi>perfect</hi> we are justified, and not by that which is <hi>imperfect.</hi> The Righteousness of Christ, which
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:212643:17"/> is out of us in him, is the only Righteousness of man which is <hi>perfect,</hi> and all our inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terousness in this life is <hi>imperfect. Ergo.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position needeth no proof; for that Justice which is not perfect cannot stand in judgment before God, and is so far from justifying, that it self is sinful, every imperfection, and defect, being <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a transgression of the Law, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a sin. <hi>Augustin</hi> saith, <hi>Peccatum est cum charitas minor est quam debet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. By that Righteousness alone, and by no other we are justified, by which the Law is fully sati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>fied, and not by any Righteousness inherent in us, or performed by us. Therefore we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by the Righteousness of Christ alone, and not by any Righteousness <hi>inherent</hi> in us, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by us. Three things are here to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged. First, That whosoever is justified, is made just by some Righteousness; for to think a man should be justified without justice, is as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd as to think a man is cloathed without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That all true Righteousness is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Law of God, which is that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Rule of Righteousness.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That there can be no Justification without the Law be satisfied, either by our selves, or by another for us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31. Now by the Righteousness of Christ the Law is fully satisfied; but by any other Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neess inherent in us, or performed by us, the Law neither is, nor can be fully satisfied.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By what Righteousness we are <hi>absolved,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:212643:18"/> redeemed, Reconciled;</hi> and for which we shall be <hi>saved,</hi> by it we are justified. But by the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ alone, we are <hi>absolved</hi> from our sins, <hi>redeemed</hi> from our iniquities, <hi>reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> to God, and shall be <hi>saved. Ergo,</hi> The Righteousness of Christ is the <hi>matter</hi> of our Righteousness before God, or the only Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness by which we are justified. To prove the <hi>Major,</hi> read <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5, 6, 7, 8. where <hi>Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Remission, or Absolution</hi> are spoken of promiscuously.</p>
               <p>Again the benefit of Redemption is explained by <hi>Remission</hi> of sin, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Titus</hi> 2.14. <hi>Psal.</hi> 133.8.</p>
               <p>Again, Being reconciled to God, and being justified are used promiscuously, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9, 10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14.</p>
               <p>Again, Salvation, and Justification, are put one for the other; for that which is the <hi>Matter</hi> of Justification, is the <hi>merit</hi> of Salvation: for by what we are justified, by that we are intituled to Salvation; and by what we receceive remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sins, by that also we receive our Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Justification may be compared to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> of a Minister to a Benefice, which giveth <hi>Jus ad rem</hi> Glorification to <hi>Induction,</hi> which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth <hi>Jus in re,</hi> or possession, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The Righteousness of God by which we are justified is not prescribed in the Law to Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but without the Law is revealed in the Gospel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21. Therefore not inherent Righteousness, but that is the matter of our Justification: for the Righteousness of God is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:212643:18"/> not prescribed in the Law to justiefication, but <hi>Inherent</hi> Righteovsness is, this being the great difference betwixt the Law, and the Gospel, that the Law to Justification requireth perfect Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be performed in our own persons: The Gospel propoundeth the Obedience of Christ, which he performed for us to be accepted in their behalf who believe in him.

               <p n="7">7. The matter of our Righteousness before Cod, as it is not <hi>only</hi> our Inherent Righteousness, so neither is it that in part: For we are not justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God, both by Faith and by Works, by Gods Righteousness and our own, by that Righteousness which is out of Christ in us, and that which is inherent in our selves: For the Scripture maketh such an opposition betwixt these two, as that they cannot stand together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3 28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4, 5.9. 3, 31, 32. 11.5, 6. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16.3.11. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The only matter of our Justification is the Righteousness, or Obedience of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9, 19.</p>
               <p n="8">8. An Imputative, not an Inherent righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is the matter of our Justification, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the righteousdess of Christ is it. For proof of that matter, see <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. where it is called the <hi>Righteousness of one, whereas if it were a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness from him in us, it would be the Justice of so many as are justified,</hi> as the <hi>Councel of Trent</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,

               <p>Whereas it may be enquired whether the <hi>Active,</hi> or <hi>Passive</hi> Obedience of Christ, or both together, be the <hi>matter</hi> of our Justification, and the Imputation thereof the <hi>Form:</hi> I Answer, that the <hi>Active,</hi> and <hi>Passive</hi> Obedience of Christ, are both in a sense, and to a degree, imputed to Believers, though not in so large a sense, as some have said, <hi>viz.</hi> as if Believers were reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:212643:20"/> by Christ their Surety to have done what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Christ himself did, <hi>viz.</hi> to have fulfilled all Righteousness, neither to have committed any thing which they ought not to have done, nor to have omitted any thing which they ought to have done: Or, as if Believers in Christ might have been said to have done whatsoever he did in the Flesh, or Christ to have done every thing that he did in their stead, room, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, and as it were for them.</p>
               <p>For whatsoever Jesus Christ was bound, as Man, by the Law of Creation, to do for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>Ex. gr.</hi> to love God with all his heart, &amp;c. he could not be said to have done for others (so as he is said to have suffered for us) or Believers to have done, in, and by him: For as Christ could not have made atonement for our sins if he had any sin of his own, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.27. <hi>Such a High Priest became us who needed not daily as those High-Priests to Offer up sacrifice first for his own sin, and then for the People's,</hi> &amp;c. So what Duty and observance Christ had to pay for himself, he could not be said to have presented to God upon our account, or we to have fulfilled these things in him, <hi>Ex. gr.</hi> That we in Christ did love God, trust in God, delight to do the Will of God, or that forasmuch as he did it we may be said to have done it also. That I say is not true. Were that true, that Christ had done every thing that the Law of God requires that Believers should do, or should ever have done; and that upon their account, that they in, and by him might have been reckoned to have
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:212643:21"/> kept the whole Law of God perfectly, and God to have accepted of his Active Obedience, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of theirs, two things would follow, <hi>viz</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Then there were no need of the <hi>Passive</hi> Obedience or sufferings of Christ on our behalf, sith believers might plead not guilty to the whole Law of God, upon the account of having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly answered to every tittle thereof, by Christ their Surety, who was appointed of God to Officiate in their stead.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither then would it be needful for us to keep the Law of God, to our power in our own Persons sith it had been kept, and observed for us by way of proxy, allowed of God for that purpose.

He who hath his place excellently well Officiated and supplyed by an able Proxy, allowed, and admitted to Officiate for him, is no more to be blam'd, or kept from his reward, than if he had serv'd it in his own Person.

'Tis said of <hi>Zachary,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, They were both righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before God, walking in all the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God blamelessly,</hi> Isa. 38.3. <hi>Remember, O Lord,</hi> said <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> &amp;c. So we read of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Abel,</hi> Mat. 23.35. <hi>and that the righteous shall go into life eternal.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.7. <hi>He that doth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is righteous.</hi> So it is said of <hi>Job,</hi> ch. 1.1. that <hi>he was an upright,</hi> i. e. <hi>a right, or righteous man, one that feared God, and eschewed evil.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this at all to the prejudice of the Doctrine of Justification, only by, and for the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ imputed to us. For it is one thing to be righteous with an inherent, habitual, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect righteousness, which may serve for some other good uses, and purposes; as namely, to glorifie God, and adorn the Gospel, to do some good therewith to our selves, and others; and another thing to be righteous with a compleat, perfect righteousness, whereby we are free'd from the Curse, or Condemning power of the Law, and have right and title given us to eternal life; forasmuch as all our sins, as well of <hi>Omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as <hi>Commission,</hi> are satisfied for by Christ: and the believer thereupon is left no more liable to punishment either of <hi>Sense,</hi> or <hi>Loss,</hi> that is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Hell, or to the missing of Heaven; than if he had in his own person made God a plenary amends for all the injury which he had done him. From inherent righteousness, a man is reckoned by God, as righteous only to such a degree, (as we call School-boys <hi>Scholars,</hi> because they have some little learning, but not enough
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:212643:24"/> to fit them for the University, or whereby to claim a degree there.) So holy men from that imperfect righteousness which they have by Gods gracious condescention, are termed just, or righteous, but not with a righteousness which renders them altogether guiltless, and faultless in the sight of God, as doth that righteousness whereby they are justified. Therefore from their inherent righteousness, though good men are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated <hi>just,</hi> yet they are not from thence or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily denominated <hi>justified,</hi> nor at all but in a less strict, and proper sense.</p>

               <p>To pardon an Offence is, in strictness of speaking, nothing else but to remit the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, or not to punish it; as when a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor worthy of Death, or Banishment, and Sentenced thereunto, hath that Sentence rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, or taken off, but is not intituled to any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or priviledge. But to justifie a sinner is not only to take off the Sentence of damnation that did lye against him (as the Scripture saith, <hi>He that believeth not is condemned already,</hi>) but by accounting and making him savingly righteous to give him right, and title to Eternal Life. Now, to reward (especially with so great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as Heaven, or to intitle a Man thereunto) is much more than not to punish him with Hell, and Eternal Death.</p>

               <p>Yet I shall not lay very much stress upon that first Argument, because it may be said that the punishment due to sinners consists not only in the miseries, and torments of Hell, but also in the loss of Heaven; so that if the whole pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment be taken away, (or which is all one, the sinner fully pardoned) he is by mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Therefore in Order to proving that Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth not consist in <hi>remission of sins,</hi> I shall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trust to these (and some following) Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. First, If wheresoever in the Scripture we find the word <hi>Justifie</hi> instead thereof we should put <hi>Pardon,</hi> where <hi>Justification, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning,</hi> where <hi>Justified, Pardoned;</hi> the notion, or construction thence arising will be found sens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and absurd, then to <hi>Justifie</hi> in the Language of Scripture (which must be adhered to, and must decide this controversie) is one thing, and to <hi>Pardon</hi> is another, <hi>Justification</hi> one thing, and <hi>Pardon of sin</hi> another.

                  <hi>Pardoned, Ergo. justification,</hi> and <hi>pardon</hi> are two distinct things. For it is an undoubted Axiom, <hi>Quae subjecto differunt inter se differunt. Those things that differ in subject,</hi> that is, the one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may be found in some Subject where the other is not, are distinct, and divers one from another.

If a Man have wronged me, I may forgive him, as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Shimei,</hi> and yet not <hi>justifie</hi> him in his dealings. And when a Man is falsly accused of wrong done to another, then he may be justified and yet nothing <hi>remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> because no wrong at all done. So we are said to <hi>justifie God,</hi> Psal. 51.4.</p>
               <p>Though in regard of a man's State, God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver remits sin where he do's not <hi>justifie;</hi> yet in regard of some particular <hi>acts,</hi> he remits sin sometimes where he justifies not, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.37, 38. <hi>Though their hearts were not upright with him, yet even of his compassion he forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not.</hi> So far forth remitted it as not instantly to destroy them for it. And sometimes God <hi>justifies</hi> when he <hi>remits</hi> not, as he did in approving <hi>Phineas</hi> his Act, as a just and righteous Act, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106.30, 31. And as he is said to justifie the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> in the discharge of his Ministry, <hi>Esay</hi> 50.8. If a Man that hath wronged another do obtain his <hi>Pardon</hi> without giving him real Satisfaction, in case he be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned for it another time, he may plead his <hi>Pardon,</hi> but not stand upon his <hi>justification.</hi> But if he has given him full Satisfaction by himself,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:212643:27"/> or Surety, he may stand upon his Justification, and plead not guilty, because he can plead <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> made, and accepted. And this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not the former, is the very case betwixt God, and Man in the justifying of a sinner: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is the main ground of the Justification of him, not made by him, but by Christ for him. To this point <hi>Bellarmin, de justif.</hi> l. 1. c. 2. Speaks as well as any Protestant, and far beyond the <hi>Socinian, vide</hi> Gataker, p. 14, 15, 16.</p>

                  <hi>Justification</hi> is the cause of <hi>Remission</hi> of sins, and <hi>Remission</hi> of sins is the proper effect of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification;</hi> therefore those two things must needs be different, and distinct. To pardon an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender is not to punish him, or to exempt him from all manner of punishment due to him for such an Offence (whether it be punishment of sense, or of loss) And the reason why God doth forbear to punish a sinner, is, because he looks upon him as a guiltless Person, for as much as he hath satisfied for his Offences, by his Surety Jesus Christ. <hi>Guilt</hi> is our Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to punishment, but when full Satisfaction is rendered, and accepted, there remains no more Obligation to punishment. And therefore it is that God doth look upon a Believer as guiltless, with reference to eternal punishments (which are by Christ satisfied for) and thereupon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beareth for ever to inflict any such punishment upon, or denounce it against him.

And this no

Was not</hi> Abraham <hi>our Father justified by works when he had offered</hi> Isaac <hi>his Son upon the Altar? Seest thou how Faith wrought with his Works, and by Works was his Faith made perfect? And the Scripture was fulfilled, which saith,</hi> Abraham <hi>believed God, and it was imputed to him for Righteousness, and he was called the Friend of God,</hi> v. 25. <hi>Ye see then, how that by Works, a Man is justified, and not by Faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> 25. <hi>Likewise also was not</hi> Rahab <hi>the Harlot justifi d by Works when she had received the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and had sent them another way?

Who sees not a violence offered to the Apostle's words, when they are thus distorted from their genuine signification to a Figurative sense? And who sees not that such a way of Arguing appears to be very absurd and self-contradicting?</p>

               <p>To be justified by <hi>Works,</hi> and by <hi>Merits,</hi> seem in the Apostle's sense to be one, and the same thing.

He should then exclude those works which are no where to be found, and therefore need not to be excluded: which seems to have been as needless, as a Question which some are said to have put, who disputed upon this problem, whether it were lawful for us to work Miracles? or whether they might lawfully work Miracles? who might have forborn to have queri'd about the lawfulness of using such a power, till they had first had such a power to use. And 2. If it be said that such works are to be found in the conceit and imagination of some men, I answer, it do's not appear that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was contending with that sort of men, or doth in all his <hi>Epistle to the Romans</hi> take notice of men of that opinion in his time. 3. Whereas there were in his time, many pretenders to Justification by <hi>Works,</hi> it seemeth most probable, that they were such who doubted not but God would take their good works as he found them, and for them gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously accept, and justifie them, as being the best works they were able to do, though they
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:212643:51"/> knew they were attended with some sailings, and imperfections. Tho some have found it too easie to them to think that God will justifie them for their sincere, though imperfect obedience; yet it seems a very hard matter for any considerate man (or person worth confuting) to think that nothing of weakness, and imperfection doth cleave to his good works. St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Rom. 1. that their <hi>Consciences did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse them</hi> (for some things) as well as excuse them in others. 5. When the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith <hi>what the Law cannot do in that it is weak through the flesh,</hi> &amp;c. though he glanceth at the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of our works, yet he seems to bring it in as a thing that was <hi>known,</hi> or needed not to be proved, that our flesh was weak, that is, we in this corrupt state could not do works that are perfectly good, and to give that which he took <hi>pro concesso,</hi> as the reason why the Law could not justifie us, <hi>viz.</hi> because we cannot keep it perfectly, and it can justifie none but them that can. 6. The Apostle in that text seems to take two things for granted, or such as would easily be owned, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That the <hi>Law</hi> (or <hi>Covenant</hi> of works) could not justifie one that could not keep it perfectly. 2. That man in his fleshly, or fallen state, or since his fall, could not do that. And by those two confessed <hi>Mediums,</hi> or Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, he proves this conclusion, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Law could not justifie fallen man. 7. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from this text, or any other, doth it appear that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was troubled with a sort of men who dream'd of their own works, being every
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:212643:52"/> way <hi>perfect,</hi> and did make it his business to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them, but only such who dream'd of being saved by their own good works, which they thought God would mercifully accept, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie them for, though they might need grains, or more than grains of allowance.</p>

Because the Apostle opposeth <hi>Working,</hi> and <hi>Believing,</hi> each to other, or rather, <hi>Believing</hi> to <hi>Working,</hi> in the matter of Justification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. <hi>But to him that workeih not, but believeth on him that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth the ungodly, his Faith is counted for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi> In this case we may say, <hi>Fides quae opus est justificat, non qua opus est.</hi> That Faith which is a good work justifieth, but not as it is a good work, (as they say, <hi>quae viva,</hi> not <hi>qua viva.</hi>) It is by Christ and his Righteousness alone, as ours <hi>Imputatively,</hi> that we are justified, as by the <hi>matter,</hi> and <hi>form</hi> of our Righteousness, and therefore Faith is but the <hi>Instrument of Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as laying on is to a Plaister.

I answer, <hi>Believers.</hi> But if it be put thus, <hi>Why</hi> is a Beliver Justified? or whence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults the Justification of a Believer? or by what is he justified?

So then it is not their <hi>Believing,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in the place of a perfect Righteousness, for, and by which Christ Justifieth them, but by <hi>bearing their iniquities,</hi> by his own obedience to the death of the Cross, on their behalf. It is not a poor mans acceptance of a great rich Match that doth enrich him, I say, the act of accepting, is not the the thing that doth it, or is the matter of his Estate, but the rich Match which is offered to him, and accepted by him.</p>
               <p>There are Miracles in Scripture ascribed to <hi>Faith,</hi> to which Faith could no otherwise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, than as an <hi>Instrument</hi> engaging the power of God to work such Miracles, or as a <hi>Condition</hi> to which the working of Miracles was promised, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.17. <hi>These signs shall follow tham that

Is the same thing greater than it self at the same time?

Now that which fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and that which shall never fail, cannot be the same. Moreover, <hi>Faith</hi> is said <hi>to work by love,</hi> which implies, that they are two distinct things. Also, <hi>Faith</hi> is said to be <hi>made perfect by love, i. e.</hi> demonstrated to be perfect, which sheweth it is not the same thing. I might add <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> are not the same, witness that expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Repentance toward God, and Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> Faith is causal to several other Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

Faith</hi> is not the name of a Christians whole <hi>Panoply,</hi> or spiritual Armor, but of one piece thereof. That indeed is called the <hi>Shield,</hi> Eph. 6.16. but <hi>Truth the Girdle.

That <hi>Justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith</hi> involves all other Graces, and is the name of all Graces in one, cannot at all be prov'd by the Apostle <hi>James</hi> his discourse of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by works: For St. <hi>James</hi> doth not mention any prrticular <hi>Grace,</hi> but <hi>Works</hi> in general, as externally, and visibly practised.

               <p>The denying of Justification to be by our own inherent Righteousness, accepted as if it were perfect, or instead of the perfect Righteousness of the Law, and asserting of Justification to be by the only Righteousness of Jesus Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by <hi>Faith</hi> alone, doth greatly tend to keep Sinners humble, and to exclude all boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (which God aimeth to do) when they shall consider that that whereby they are justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is not in themselves, this being certain that we are more apt to be proud of what is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be in us, than of what is <hi>imputed</hi> to us. As a Debtor hath less to boast of when the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his <hi>Surety</hi> is imputed to him for his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, than if by his industry he had procured something to pay for himself, although the stock had been freely bestowed on him by the <hi>Surety.</hi> 'Tis evident by the Apostles words, that that can
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:212643:56"/> be no true notion of the way of God's justify<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing a sinner which doth leave any room, or place, or pretence for boasting, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2. <hi>If</hi> Abraham <hi>were justified by works, he hath whereof to boast</hi> (or glory) <hi>q. d.</hi> That is Argument enough to prove that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not Justified by works. He adds as a <hi>minor</hi> proposition or assumption, <hi>But not before God,</hi> meaning, But he had no cause to glory, or to boast before God. <hi>Ergo.</hi> He was not justified by works.</p>

               <p>Our Justification is as free to us (though 'twere not so to Christ) as any Pardon ever was to a Traytor. Now, unto a Pardon freely given there is nothing required but the hearty acceptance of it upon the terms of promising to be a Faithful Subject for time to come, or so. Now, though such a Pardon cost a man nothing, and is abundantly sufficient for his discharge, yet must he come and plead this Pardon in open
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:212643:56"/> Court, he must produce it, and insist upon it, before his Judge, in arrest of Judgment, that the Sentence denounced against him may not be Executed. A Traytor that is so acquitted, cannot be said to be acquitted by his willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to accept of a pardon, or to produce it in Court when obtained (for what Malefactor is not willing to do these two things?) But by the <hi>Pardon</hi> it's self it is that a Traytor is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, though he cannot have the benefit of his Pardon, if it be only tendered, unless it be also <hi>accepted,</hi> and pleaded by him. Now, to accept, and plead his Pardon, when nothing else but that is required of him, renders it no less <hi>free,</hi> than if he mjght have had it without accepting, or at leastwise, without pleading of it. But were he for his <hi>Pardon,</hi> and in order to the procurement thereof, to be a Servant all the dayes of his Life, that would alter the case, and make his <hi>pardon unfree.</hi>

               <p>In saying that <hi>Faith</hi> is the <hi>Instrumental</hi> cause, or <hi>Condition</hi> of Justification, we ascribe much more to it than if we had called it only <hi>causa sine qua non.</hi> For <hi>causa sine qua non</hi> do's <hi>nihil ponere in esse,</hi> it produceth nothing; no effect doth

               <p>The fore-going Proposition will not seem strange if we consider, That to be Justified by Christ, and by Faith, or by the Righteousness of Christ, and by the Righteousness of Faith, are still one in Scripture, even then where that concurrence which is allowed to Faith is deny'd to all other things, which sheweth, that Faith concurreth peculiarly, and that it justifieth by obtaining Justification through Christ. 2.

               <p>Some to make way for Works being a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Justification as well as Faith, do say that Justification is not an instantaneous, but a continued Act: but in the sense they do affirm it is false.

As a Man is married but once, to one Woman, but though his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to Marry be given at once, and the same instant they are Man and Wife; yet that an Instantareous Act of his in declaring his consent to Marry, abideth for ever, as long as they two shall Live.</p>

               <p>That Justification is no continued Act, I prove thus. 1.

Our being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Covenant of Grace as to a right to the saving Blessings promised therein is no continued, but an instantaneous Act. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification is so.

A Believer, for that he is such, or as, and as soon as he is such, hath a Righteousness that can abide the Trial in Justice. Therefore Justification can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a continued Act. For if the Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a Sinner were but a perfecting, it could not be said that he had an Actual, perfect Righteousness (as that of Christ imputed to him is) but only that it were a perfecting.</p>

               <p>The disproving of Justification to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Act, plainly proveth Faith and Works joyned together not to be the Condition thereof. For if so, no man could be justified till the close

Now the expressions of the Old Testament run thus: <hi>When a man sinneth he shall bring an Offering,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and he shall put his hand upon the head of the Burnt offering, and it shall be accepted for him, to make Atonement for him,</hi> &amp;c. In those words God did propose something as a Righteousness for a sinner, which was to be accepted for him; yet none will say that it was the external Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it self that was to be accepted for such, nor that it was the Faith of the Offerer alone, that was so accepted: For then there needed no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, but it behoved to be the thing Typefied by that Sacrifice, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sacrifice of Christ
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:212643:67"/> look'd to by the Faith of the Offerer, that was so accepted. Yet the external Sacrifices in the Old Testament, are as expressly said to be accepted for a sinners Justification, or an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for him, as Faith is said to be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Righteousness in the New. And as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said that by vertue of Christ's Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Covenant with him, it was procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that such Performances, and Sacrifices, should be accepted of themselves as the person's immediate Evangelical Righteousness: (though their Ceremonial Law was their Gospel) So it cannot be said that there is any such bargain concerning Faith in the New Testament, but that Christ apprehended by Faith is the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness both in the Old, and New Testament, which is the thing that we intend, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Formal Cause</hi> of our Justification must needs be the Imputation of that Righteousness: for by means thereof it is that we are justifi'd from guilt, and accepted to life as effectually as if we were <hi>formaly just,</hi> by a perfect Righteousness inherent in us: that imputation with reference to the fruits, and effects thereof, is as it were a <hi>formal inherent Righteousness: i. e.</hi> as beneficial to us as if it were such.

               <p>Mr. <hi>Sherlock's</hi> Tenet assigneth that for the <hi>matter</hi> or <hi>material cause</hi> of our Justification, which I have clearly proved is not, <hi>viz.</hi> our own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, or Obedience to the Gospel. If a Righteousness that is <hi>Imputed</hi> be not the matter of our Righteousness before God, as he saith it is not, then our Inherent Righteousness must: for we must be justified by some Righteousness or other; and every Righteousness must consist of something, and that whereof it consists is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the matter, or material cause of it: <hi>i. e.</hi> Gospel obedience is the very thing which caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a man to stand righteous before God, and to be accepted to life everlasting. Now that it is not so (besides what hath been said already to the contrary) I prove thus; <hi>viz.</hi> To justifie a sinner, is to declare him guiltless, and faultless, as being really so, for that by his Surety he hath satisfied for all his Trespasses. But God cannot declare a sinner guiltless, and faultless, and one who has satisfied the Law, by, and upon the account of his own Inherent, and Imperfect O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: For then should the Judgment of God not be according to Truth. Again, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Justification doth involve Remission of sins as a necessary effect from that cause (for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit sin is not to punish it eternally, and God cannot punish their sins, whom he hath declared to have satisfied his Justice by Christ, so as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt them from eternal punishment) only that Righteousness can be said to justifie us,

               <head>CLXXXVII.</head>
               <p>That the strength of such an Argument as that is but weakness, I affirm, First upon this ground, Because there might be sufficient reason for our Saviour to omit the Preaching of some great, and considerable Truths, as namely because they were known, and believed before. As some things that are plain in the light of Nature, the Scripture saith little of, and the New Testament saith little or nothing, of those things which were plainly revealed before in the Old. Now that the Justification of a sinner should be by the Righteousness, Suffering, and Satisfaction of the <hi>Messias,</hi> was plainly revealed in the Old Testament, <hi>ex gr.</hi> Isa. 53.11. <hi>By his knowledg shall my Righteous Servant justifie many, for he shall bear their iniquities.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>He was
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:212643:76"/> wounded for our Transgressions, the chastisements of our peace were upon him, and by his stripes we are healed.</hi> v. 6. <hi>All we like sheep have gone astray, and God hath laid on him the iniquity of us all,</hi> &amp;c. Dan. 12.24. <hi>Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people to finish the transgressions, and to make an end of sins, to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting Righteousness,</hi> &amp;c. The whole <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law, or the greatest part of it (which was a kind of visible Gospel) did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually preach this Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us from punishment, and accepting of us to life, and favor with God, was to be upon the account of another, the inocent suffering for the nocent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What else was meant by all the bloudy Sacrifices offered for the sins of the people, in which God accepted the life of a harmless spotless Lamb, as a ransom for the life of a spotted, guilty sinner? all these things typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, and pointing out, that <hi>without bloud there could be no Remission of sins.</hi> Dan. 9.26. <hi>The Messias shall be cut off, but not for himself.</hi> If then there were a sufficient Light shining in the Old Testament, in <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Prophets, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that the Justification of a Sinner, or his being pardoned and accepted with God; was, and always should be by means of another: and particularly by the sufferings of another; and that a harmless, unspotted person; and that the <hi>Messias</hi> was ne that should suffer for our sins, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.8. <hi>He was cut off out of the land of the living, for the Transgression of my people was he stricken.</hi> v. 10. <hi>When thou shalt make his soul an

What expressions can be plainer than these? These things considered, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our needed not to insist much upon Justification, and Salvation by the righteousness and sufferings of the Messias, sith so much had been said of that by the Prophets of the Old Testament. And if it be said that the Disciples of Christ, nevertheless were very ignorant of the intended death of Christ, witness <hi>Peter,</hi> who said, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, these things shall not happen to thee,</hi> when Christ foretold his death, yet our Saviour might not think fit to enlarge much, and often upon that subject, lest his Disciples should not be able to bear the thoughts of it, like an indulgent ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Wife, that cannot bear to hear much said of her Husbands dying, before her self. See <hi>John</hi> 16.12.</p>

               <p>If from a total silence concerning Imputed Righteousness in all the four Gospels we could not have gathered any such thing (because there might be good reason for saying nothing of it) much less can we safely conclude there is no such thing meerly from its not being mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there in so many words, as long as we find other expressions, and passages in these texts; <hi>viz.</hi> in the Histories, Sermons, and Parables of Christ, which are <hi>Tantamount,</hi> or which do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:212643:77"/> imply our being Justified by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, or Obedience, by the Death and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of another. Do's not our Saviour say, <hi>John</hi> 6.5. <hi>If any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever, and the bread which I shall give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the whole world.</hi> Did not the Voice from Heaven say, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased?</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that we are made accepted to God by Christ, and upon his account. Do's not Christ say, <hi>This is my bloud of the New Testament which is shed for the Remission of sins?</hi> intimating that the pardon of our sins, upon which a title to eternal life necessarily insueth, (for what then can hinder us?) is upon the account of the bloud of Christ, shed for us, which is the thing that we chiefly mean by that righteousness of Christ which is imputed to Believers; <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Obedience to the death of the Cross,</hi> &amp;c. (which was an act of righteousness in Christ for that he had promised it, and his so doing was in pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and performance of his Promise, <hi>&amp;c.) I come to do thy will, O God, as it is written of me in the volume of thy book.</hi> It was indeed both the effect of righteousness in Christ, and it is the cause of righteousness in Believers: for upon that account are they accepted of God righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous to eternal life, and therefore may well be call'd the righteousness of Christ. According as some excellent Divines expound that text, <hi>John</hi> 16.10. <hi>He</hi> (speaking of the Spirit,) <hi>shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the world of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you see me no more,</hi> It makes greatly
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:212643:78"/> for <hi>Imputed Righteousness.</hi> For say they, the meaning of these words is this, The world shall be convinced that Jesus Christ hath satisfied the Justice of God to the utmost, for that he should maintain his standing in Heaven, and they should see him upon earth no more: whereas, if he had left any part of the debt unpaid, or had not fulfilled all righteousness, he should have been sent back again to the earth whence he came, whereas contrary to that the Scripture saith, that as <hi>Christ died for our sins, viz.</hi> to pay our debt, <hi>so he rose again for our Justification; viz.</hi> to manifest he was fully acquitted from all that was imputed to him, and should <hi>appear the second time without sin,</hi> &amp;c. Were the <hi>Israelites</hi> that had been stung with fiery Serpents, cured by a meer act of vision, or looking simply consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or were they not cured principally by the virtue that was in the Brazen Serpent? It was the Brazen Serpent that cured them, and not they themselves? Now Christ saith plainly, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>As Moses lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</hi> (viz. upon the Cross) <hi>That whosoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</hi> It was by Christ Crucified that Believers were to have eternal life: and if so, then the Obedience of Christ to the death of the Cross, was, and is imputed to Believers; else how come they to have such benefit thereby? If it were not reckoned that Christ suffered in their stead, to satisfie for their sins, or as their <hi>Surety,</hi> whose payment was, and is accepted of God
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:212643:78"/> for them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What mean those words of Christ, <hi>John</hi> 10.15. <hi>I lay down my life for the sheep?</hi> if the laying down his life be not imputed, or reckoned to his sheep, or accepted on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half as a Propitiatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for their sins? Do we not read in <hi>Luke</hi> 2.68, 74. of God's redeeming his people by Christ, and <hi>raising up a horn of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for them in the house of David; As he spake by the mouth of his Prophets, which have been since the world began: That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, might serve him without fear.</hi> Now could all this be done without satisfying Divine Justice for sins, since God did insist upon having satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for <hi>without bloud there is no remission of sins:</hi> and the High priest was inspir'd when he said, <hi>It was necessary that one should die for the people.</hi> Do we not read, <hi>John</hi> 1.29. these words applyed to Christ, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the sins of the world.</hi> How did he do that but by being slain for the sins of the world? Now if his death, and slaughter, be not <hi>imputed,</hi> or reckoned to us, we shall be never the better for it. So also, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whosoever believeth on him might have eternal life.</hi> So then Christ as given, <hi>viz.</hi> to be crucified, and delivered up to death for us, is the principal cause of our esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Hell, or attaining eternal life; to both which Justification entitleth us. Now how should our title to deliverance from Hell, and to the enjoyment of eternal life, result from thence, if Christ dying upon the Cross were not
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:212643:79"/> imputed, or reckoned by God so us, as if we had made satisfaction to his justice, since Christ our Surety hath done it to the full? To conclude with those Sacramental words of our Saviour, <hi>This is my body which was broken for you.</hi> If the breaking of Christ's body be not imputed, or reckoned to us as a satisfaction made for us, or in our behalf, and so accepted of the Father, I see not how his body was broken for us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sith then all the forementioned places (and it is like several others in the Gospels) do hold forth the sum, and substance of what we intend by <hi>Imputed Righteousness,</hi> though not assert it Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labically, or in so many words, it can be no just exception against that Doctrine its being a truth.</p>

               <p>Another thing in which Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> symbolizeth with <hi>Papists</hi> is, in that he averreth Justification to be by <hi>Inherent,</hi> or by our own internal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, as they do, thereby confounding <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and turning the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace</hi> into a <hi>Covenant of Works;</hi> or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king these two Covenants (which are specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally distinct,) to differ only <hi>secundum magis &amp; minus.</hi> For according to him, we are justified by our obedience to the Gospel; and what is that but the effect of Grace infused, or the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and putting forth of inherent Grace, or if you please, our own improvement of that Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of Grace which God hath bestowed upon us, and consequently, as I said before, we may

               <p>
                  <hi>In the Homilie, or Sermon</hi> of Salvation, <hi>we find such passages as follow.</hi> Because all men be sinners, and Offenders against God, therefore can
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:212643:81"/> no man by his own Acts Works, and Deeds (seem they never so good) be justified, and made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before God: but every man of necessity is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to seek for another righteousness, or justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to be received at God's own hands, <hi>&amp;c. Again,</hi> God sent his only son into the World to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the Law for us, and by shedding his most precious Blood to make a sacrifice and satisfaction, <hi>or (as it may be called)</hi> amends to his Father for our sins, <hi>&amp;c. Again,</hi> The Grace of God doth not shut out the justice of God in our justification, but only shutteth out the justice of man, that is, the justice of our Works, <hi>&amp;c. Again,</hi> Faith doth not shut out Repentance, Hope, Love, and the fear of God to be joyned with Faith in every man that is justified, but it shutteth them out from the effect of justifying. <hi>Yet more plainly in the same Homily.</hi> So that Christ is now the righteousness of them that do truly believe in him. He for them paid the ransom by his death. He for them fulfilled the Law in his Life. So that now in him, and by him every true Christian may be celled a fulfiller of the Law: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as that which their infirmity lacketh, Christs justice hath supplyed. <hi>Again, in the second</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Salvation, <hi>we meet with such passages as follow.</hi> Consider diligently these words without works, by Faith only, freely we receive remission of our sins; what can be spoken more plainly, than to say, That freely, without works, by Faith only, we obtain remission of our sins? This Doctrine (viz. <hi>That Faith only justifieth, as the margent shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>) advanceth the true Glory of Christ, and beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down the vain glory of man: This whosoever
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:212643:82"/> denieth is not to be accounted for a Christian man, nor for a setter forth of Christ's Glory, but for an Adversary to Christ, and his Gospel, and for a setter forth of mans vain-glory. <hi>Let Mr.</hi> Sherlock <hi>weigh those words well. Again,</hi> Man cannot make himself righteous by his own works, neither in part, nor in the whole, for that were the greatest arrogancy, and presumption of man, that Anti-Christ could set up against God, to affirm that a man might by his own works take away and purge his own sins, and so justifie himself. <hi>Again,</hi> The true understanding of this Doctrine; we be justified freely by Faith without works, or that we be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith in Christ only, is not that this our own act to believe in Christ doth justifie us, for that were to count our selves to be justified by some act, or vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue that is in our selves, <hi>&amp;c. Towards the end of that Homily are these words,</hi> So that our Faith in Christ (as it were) saith unto us thus; It is not I that take away your sins, but it is Christ only I send you to for that purpose, forsaking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all your good virtues, words, thoughts, and works, and only putting your trust in Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again, in the third Homily of Salvation, are these expressions.</hi> Nevertheless because Faith doth directly send us to Christ for remission of our sins, and that by Faith given us of God we embrace the promise of God's Mercy, and of the remission of our sins (which thing none other of our virtues, or works properly doth) therefore Scripture useth to say, that Faith without works doth justifie.</p>

               <p>He that runs may read the fore said passages quoted out of the three Homilies <hi>of Salvation</hi> to be directly opposite to several notions deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> in his Book, in reference to the Doctrine of Justification. For 1. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> confoundeth justifying <hi>Faith</hi> and all other Graces, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Gospel-Obedience, Faith</hi> and <hi>sincere good works,</hi> and maketh as if they were one, and the same thing (witness what he saith in p. 273. of his Book) the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies fore-quoted do manifestly distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Faith</hi> and other Graces, but more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betwixt Faith and good works. Witness that passage, <hi>Faith doth not shut out Hope, Love, Repentance, and the fear of God to be joyned with Faith in every man that is justified, but it shuts them out from the Office of justifying.</hi> Now, if Faith, and all these Graces were one, and the same Faith should shut out it self from the Office of justifying, according to them. Divers passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges fore-quoted do shew that the Homilies do frequently oppose <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>works, Ex. gr.</hi> this for one. <hi>Consider diligently these words without works by Faith only freely we receive remission of our sins: what can be spoken more plainly, than to say, that freely, without works, by Faith only we obtain remission of our sins?</hi> 2. Whereas Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> interesseth all Evangelick Obedience, internal Holiness, and sincere good works, in justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as truly, and as much, as <hi>Faith</hi> it self (as he must needs do who makes them the same with
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:212643:83"/> Faith, or to be Faith it self) divers passages alledged out of the Homilies in the fore-going Thesis do expresly deny and contradict that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion of his; witness that terrible passage which I would wish Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> to think of, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That <hi>Faith only</hi> (that is, without works concurring as to that, for that the Margent shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be the thing treated of) <hi>justifieth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth the true glory of Christ, and beateth down the vain-glory of man: This whosoever denieth is not to be accounted for a Christian man, nor for a setter forth of Christ's glory; but for an adversary to Christ and his Gospel, and for a setter forth of man's vain-glory.</hi> 3. Whereas Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> makes as if Faith it self, the very <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>credere,</hi> the habit, or act of believing (whatsoever he understands thereby) were the matter of our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or our very Evangelical Righteousness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, the Homily is plain against him in these words. <hi>The true understanding of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine we be justified freely by Faith without Works, is not that this our act to believe in Christ doth justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us, for that were to count our selves to be justified by some act, or virtue in our selves.</hi> 4. Whereas Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> utterly denyeth, and derideth <hi>Imputed Righteousness,</hi> witness the passages which I have quoted out of his Book in <hi>Thesis</hi> 179. to which I shall add one or two more, <hi>viz.</hi> that in <hi>p.</hi> 276. of Mr. <hi>Sh</hi>'s. book, where he concludes thus. <hi>Thus you see that there is no foundation in Scripture for all this talk of personal Rigteousness of Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in him, and imputed to us</hi> Also, <hi>Sh.</hi> p. 273. <hi>Thus you see how the Apostle opposeth the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:212643:83"/> of the Law to the Righteousness of Faith, not as an inherent, and personal to an Imputed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness; but as an external, and Ritual, to an inherent, real, and substantial Righteousness This is</hi> (saith <hi>Mr.</hi> Sh.) <hi>the</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all other mistakes in this matter, that by the righteousness of the Law, and the righteousness of Works, most men understand an inherent holiness, the conformity of our hearts, and lives to all moral Precepts, and Rules of good life; and then conclude that if this righteousness will not please God, nothing but an imputed righteousness can, though I should have rather concluded that nothing can: but the truth is, the righteousness of the Law, and of Works in the New Testament signifies only an external righteousness, which cannot please God; and that internal holiness which they call the righteousness of the Law, is that very righteousness of Faith which the Gospel commands, and which God approves, and rewards, and this imputed righteousness is no where to be found, that I know of, but in their own fancies.</hi> If this long Paragraph be not quite contrary to what the <hi>Homily</hi> declareth, I am much deceived. The words of the <hi>Homily</hi> are these. <hi>Man cannot make himself righteous by his own works, neither in part, nor in the whole; for that were the greatest Arrogancy, and Presumption of man, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ could set up against God, to affirm that a man might by his own works take away his own sins, and so justifie himself.</hi> But saith Mr. <hi>Sh.

And again, <hi>God sent his only Son into the world to fulfil the Law for us, and by shedding his most precious blood to make a sacrifice and satisfaction, and (as it may be called) amends to his Father for our sins,</hi> &amp;c. Which passage in the Homily plainly tells us another way how God comes to be pleased with sinners, so far forth as to justifie them: then upon their inherent righteousness, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal holiness (which yet is very necessary for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purposes) <hi>viz.</hi> upon the account of Christ his atonement, and satisfaction, which being not theirs subjectively, and <hi>inherently</hi> if it be not <hi>imputed</hi> to them, they can have no benefit by it. The Homily saith expressly, that <hi>every man is constrained to seek another righteousness (viz.</hi> than that of his own works and deeds) <hi>to be received at God's own hand.</hi> The Homily tells you that our very <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>believing</hi> is far from justifying us, or being the matter of our righteousness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, witness these words. <hi>So that our Faith in Christ (as it were) saith to us thus. It is not I that can take away your sins, but it is Christ only; I send you to him for that purpose, forsaking therein all your good virtue, thoughts, words, and works, and only putting your trust in Christ,</hi> &amp;c. Again, The
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:212643:84"/> third <hi>Homily of Salvation</hi> saith, <hi>Faith doth direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly send us to Christ for remission of sins, and that by Faith we imbrace the promise of God's mercy (which thing no other of our virtues, or works properly doth) therefore scripture useth to say, that Faith without works doth justifie.</hi> which passage, forasmuch as it excludeth other graces, and works, besides <hi>Faith,</hi> from the justifying of a sinner upon this account; that they do not, like <hi>Faith,</hi> properly imbrace the promise of God's mercy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sin, plainly implieth, and intimateth, that Faith doth justifie only <hi>correlatively</hi> to its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Christ, and his righteousness, which can be made ours no otherwise than by <hi>imputation,</hi> or gracious accepting of us as if we were perfectly righteous with an inherent formal righteousness of our own, sith it is not ours internally. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is such a thing as <hi>imputed righteousness,</hi> and that Faith that lays hold upon it is a grace by it self, distinct from other graces, and other good works, and is the only instrument on mans part, whereby he is justified. All this I say is true if the <hi>Homilies</hi> of the <hi>Church of England</hi> may be credited. And now methinks I hear those men who find the <hi>Articles,</hi> and the <hi>Homilies of the Church of England</hi> to stand so much in their light, crying out concerning those that pen'd them, <hi>Ʋtinam nesciissent literas</hi> (as one concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self) would to God they had been illiterate men, that had never learnd to write: and (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that the Doctrine of <hi>imputed righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> will destroy all good <hi>Ethiks</hi>) making bold to abuse the <hi>Homilies,</hi> and that text toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

                  <hi>Whereas in my</hi> Prodromus <hi>I undertook to produce nine eminent Bishops, (eight of them of the</hi> Church of England) <hi>all setting their faces against that notion of Justification which Mr.</hi> Sherlock <hi>hath delivered to us,</hi> viz. <hi>that we are not justified by the righteousness of Christ</hi> imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>to us, but by our own sincere obedience to the Gospel (which, saith he, is called the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Faith) having already produced two of the nine,</hi> viz. <hi>Bp.</hi> Davenant, <hi>and Bp.</hi>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:212643:85"/> Dounam, <hi>in variety of instances; there remains but seven, the first whereof I shall now instance in is Bp.</hi> Hall, <hi>whom I find as opposite to Mr.</hi> Sherlock <hi>in this matter, as a man can be. His words are as follow.</hi> The Evangelical Justice (<hi>saith Bp.</hi> Hall) is not without the intervention of a Saviour; to which claim is laid in two kinds: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as imputative, or as inherent. The inherent wrought in us, the imputed wrought for us. It is the main care of our lives, and deaths, what shall give us peace, and acceptation before the dreadful Tribunal of God: What but righteousness? What righteousness, or whose? Ours, or Christ's? Ours in the inherent graces wrought in us, in the holy works wrought by us; or Christ's in his most perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and meritorious satisfaction wrought for us, and applyed to us? The Tridentine faction is for the former (<hi>and so we may say is Mr.</hi> Sh.) we for the latter. God is as direct on our side as his word can make him; every where blazening the defects of our our own righteousness, the imperfections of our best graces, the deadly nature of our least sins, the radical sinfulness rf our habitual concupiscence, the pollution of our best works: every where extolling the perfect obedience of our Redeemer, the gracious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pplication of that obedience, the sweet comfort of that application, the assurance and unfailableness of that comfort; and lastly, our happy rest in that assur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. We were to us if we were not more just in that, than sanctified in our selves. We are sanctified in part, according to the weakness of our receit, we are justified throughly according to the perfectness of thy acceptation. Were we throughly sanctified here, we
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:212643:86"/> should be more than men, were we not throughly ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified we should be no more than sinners before thee, while we stand before thee as sinners we can have no peace. Let others trust in the Chariots and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of their own strength, we will remember the Lord our God. The work of thy Justice (or righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness) shall be our Peace. <hi>Thus far that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and acute Bishop.</hi>

               <p>The Learned Bishop <hi>Prideaux,</hi> sometimes professor of Divinity at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in his Book called <hi>Fasciculus Controversiarum</hi> (over and above what may be met with in his other works) giveth ample testimony to the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of Believers their being justified by the Righteousness of Christ imputed to them, and received by Faith alone.

As there is a Personal and individual unity whereby a man is one, in, and by himself: So there is a common unity whereby a man is one with another. And this is the ground of righteousness imputed.

The latter in <hi>St. John 1.3, 7. He that doth righteousness is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi> A righteousness done. The one is a quality of the party, the other an act of the Judge declaring, or pronouncing righteous. The one ours by influence, or infusion, the other by accompt, or imputation: when Christ is called Jehovah, our righteousness, that great Bishop expoundeth it of righteousness im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted: For (saith he <hi>p. 76.</hi>) The tenour of the Scripture touching our Justification all along runs in judicial terms. When we shall once be brought and arraigned before the righteous judge sitting upon the throne (<hi>which he speaks alluding to</hi> Prov. <hi>20.8.</hi>) we shall there see that righteousness in that sense <hi>(whereby he meaneth inherent righteousness)</hi> will not abide the trial. Bring them hither then <hi>(meaning to God's Tribunal)</hi> and ask them here of this name, and never a Saint, nor Father, no not the Schoolmen themselves, but will shew how to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it aright.

Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> dareth not stand here, but desireth God not to enter into judgment with him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if we must come (<hi>viz.</hi> to the judgment of God, as thither we must come all) then he will never account his own righteousness, but make mention of this name, <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah justitia nostra. Daniel,</hi> that man so greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, after he saw the Antient of days set down on his Throne, and the book open before him there: Not in our righteousness, <hi>Dan. 9.18.</hi> Yet was that righteousness <hi>a Jehovah,</hi> (from the Lord) but here it would not serve, he must wait for the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, and the everlasting righteousness which he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with him. <hi>Esay,</hi> at the Vision of God sitting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Throne, crieth out. Woe is me, I am a man of polluted lips: Woe is me, for I have held my peace. There he seeth that the very sins of omission, and the uery sins of his lips would be enough to condemn him, though he had never in act committed any. <hi>St. Paul</hi> saith, Though I know nothing by my self, and so had Justification <hi>a Domino,</hi> I am not therefore justified: It is another righteousness, and not that, must acquit him.

And indeed, saith he, so far as concerneth satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for sin, and our escaping from eternal death, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> taketh this name aright, and now they find no such absurdity in it, that Christ his rightheousness, and merit, are imputed to us: but in the positive Justice, or that part thereof which is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious for reward, there fall they into a phansie that a righteousness inherent in themselves, without the righteousness that is in Christ, will serve them. The reason, saith <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> why in satisfaction for sin we need Crist's righteousness to be accounted ours is because the offence is infinite. We reason <hi>a pari.</hi> There must also be a an infinite merit, because the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is no less infinite. Is there not as much required to purchase for us the Crown of Glory, as to redeem us from the torments of Hell? <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> after his long Disputation, taking upon him to answer a case of Conscience, whether a man might repose any trust in that which he had so long argued for, saith at last, that <hi>Propter incertitudinem propriae Justitiae, &amp; periculum inanis gloriae, tutissimum est fiduciam totam in sola Dei misericordia reponere.</hi> That is, Considering the uncertainty of man's righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the dangerousness of vain-glory, it is most safe to repose all our confidence in the mercy of God alone. <hi>Thus far Bp.</hi> Andrews, <hi>besides several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther passages which might be gathered out of his Sermon of</hi> Justification, <hi>on</hi> Jer. <hi>23.6. which he translates thus;</hi> This is the name whereby they shall call him, The Lord our Righteousness. <hi>Plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:212643:91"/> God willing, by better Arguments than he shall be able to disprove.</hi> 2. In p. 382. he saith,</p>
               <p>It is truly said by Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> that <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>in teaching justification by Works doth raze the very Foundation of Christian Faith, and maketh Christ but a counterfeit and false Christ; because, as saith the Apostle, If Righteousness be by the Law, then Christ dyed in vain,</hi> Gal. 2.21. <hi>Therefore peremptorily he denounceth, Ye are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished from Christ, ye are fallen from Grace who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever are justified by the Law,</hi> Gal. 5.4. 3. In p. 384. <hi>In whom</hi> (speaking of Christ) <hi>and not in our selves, we are made the Righteousness of God; that is, just in the sight of God, in that his Obedience, and Righteousness performed and wrought in our Name, and for our behoof, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto us, by Faith in his Blood.</hi> 4 In p. 388. <hi>Bp.</hi> Abbot <hi>vindicates Mr.</hi> Perkins his first reason for imputed Righteousness, <hi>viz. That which must be our Righteousness before God must satisfie the Justice of the Law, which saith, Do these things and thou shalt live. But there is nothing that can satisfie that justice of the Law but the Righteousness, and Obedience of Christ. Ergo.</hi> 5. In p. 400. he vindicates Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reason for imputed Righteousness, <hi>viz.</hi> That, <hi>As Christ was made sin for us, so we are made the Righteousness of God in him.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>But Christ was made sin by the Imputation of our sins, he being most Holy: Therefore a sinner is made Righteous in that Christs Righteousness is Imputed to him.</hi> 6.

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:212643:91"/> Reason for imputed Righteousness, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>As by one mans disobedience,</hi> &amp;c. whence he argues thus. <hi>As by the disobedience of</hi> Adam <hi>men were made sinners, so by the Obedience of Christ they are made righteous: But men are made Sinners by Imputation of</hi> Adam's <hi>sin unto them,</hi> Ergo. <hi>By Imputation of Christ's Justice we are made righteous.</hi> 7. In p. 413. he vindicateth Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> his fourth and last Reason for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Righteousness, taken from the consent of the Ancient Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 8. In p. 422. <hi>Bp.

               <p>Justification, <hi>saith he,</hi> is the Sentence of God, whereby he of his Grace for the righteousness of his Son, by him imputed to us, and through Faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by us, doth free us from sin and Death,
<pb n="793" facs="tcp:212643:92"/> and account us righteous unto Life. For hereby we both have a deliverance from the Guilt, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all our sins, and being accounted righteous in the sight of God by the righteousness of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Christ imputed to us, are restored to a better Righteousness than ever we had in <hi>Adam. p. 194.</hi> Thus God imputing the righteousness of Christ to a sinner doth not account his sins to him, but interests him in a state of as full, and perfect freedom, and acceptance, as if he had never sinned, or had him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self fully satisfied. The matter of Justification, or that righteousness whereby a sinner stands justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in God's sight, is not any righteousness inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in his own Person, and performed by him, but a perfect righteousness inherent in Christ, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed for him. The Form, or being Cause of our justification, and that which makes the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ so really ours that it doth justifie us is the gracious Imputation of God the Father ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting his Son's righteousness unto the sinner, and by that allowing, making it his to all effects, as if he himself had performed it. <hi>Thus far Bp.</hi> Ʋsher. <hi>Then he puts the Question.</hi> But how can Christ's righteousness be accounted ours? Is it not as absurd to say that we are justified by Christ's righteousness, as that a man should be wise with the wisdom of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Answereth it thus; no doubtless, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this righteousness is in Christ, not as in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son severed from us, but as in the Head of the Church, the second <hi>Adam,</hi> from whom therefore it is communicated to all, who being united as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to him do lay claim thereunto, and apply it unto themselves, <hi>Rom. 5.19. Rom. 10.4.</hi> For if
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:212643:93"/> the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> were of force to condemn us all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we were in his Loins, he being the head of our common Nature; why then should it seem strange that the Righteousness of our Saviour Christ, both God, and Man, should be available to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie those that are interessed in him especially conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring we have a more strict conjunction in the Spirit with him, than ever we had in Nature with <hi>Adam?</hi> And though it be not fit to measure Heavenly things by the Yard of reason, yet it is not unreasonable that a man owing a thousand pound<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The opposers of Christ's <hi>Imputed righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and of Justification by Faith alone, on Man's part, are found Fighters not only against the Writings of the Generality of the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Divines of the Reformed Churches (as I have instanced in above thirty) but also against many Renowned Bishops of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whose Names and sayings have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and not against them only, but also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Homilies,</hi> as hath been made appear by several passages alledged from thence, which are point blank against them; yea, over
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:212643:93"/> and above all that, they will appear to fight against the <hi>eleventh Article of the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, stiled; <hi>Of the justification of man.</hi> For that <hi>Article</hi> runs thus; <hi>We are accounted righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, by Faith, and not for our own Works, or deservings. Wherefore that we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith only is most wholsom Doctrine, and full of comfort.</hi> Those are the very words of the Article. By the <hi>merits</hi> of Christ doubtless are meant his Active, and Passive Obedience, or what he did and suffered for Believers, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to meriting and purchasing Eternal Life for them, which Obedience of our Saviour we call his <hi>righteousness.</hi> Now, saith the Article, we are accounted Righteous before God (that is, we are justified <hi>only for the merit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</hi> But, saith Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> (and as many as are of his mind) we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Righteous before God for our sincere Obedience to the Gospel, or for our internal Holiness. For, saith he, <hi>p.</hi> 273. having spoken just before <hi>of Internal Holiness, and the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of our hearts and Lives to all moral Precepts. If this righteousness will not please God, I should have concluded that nothing can.</hi> He goes on, and saith, <hi>That Internal Holiness, which they call the righteousness of the Law, is that very righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Faith which the Gospel commands, and which God approves and rewards; and this Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted righteousness is no where to be found but in their own fancies.</hi> From those words of his I Argue thus against him. A man is counted Righteous
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:212643:94"/> before God (or justified, which is the same thing) for that which is his Righteousness, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially his only Righteousness in the sight of God. But according to Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> our only E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Righteousness in the sight of God is our internal Holiness, and conformity of our hearts and lives to all moral Principles, and Rules of a good life. <hi>Ergo.</hi> By our internal Holiness we are counted righteous (savingly) or justified in the sight of God. Imputed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness being no where to be found that Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> knows of, but in mens own fancies, men must necessarily be justified by inherent Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, according to Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> or without any righteousness at all. The latter cannot be, that a man should be righteous without any righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; therefore he is so in the sight of God, and to salvation (for that we are speaking of) by, and for his inherent holiness, or Gospel obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And if so, Then Believers are not account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed righteous before God, only for the merit of Jesus Christ (as the Article saith) yea so far from that, that they are not counted righteous before God, so much as partly, or in part, for the merit of Christ, because their only righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness (according to Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi>) is their internal holiness, and conformity to moral Precepts. Again, If we are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of Jesus Christ, as the Article saith, then we are so accounted by, and for, an <hi>imputed righteousness;</hi> yea by, and for an <hi>imputed righteousness</hi> only. For there are but two ways whereby any righteousness can be
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:212643:94"/> ours: <hi>viz.</hi> either by <hi>Inherency,</hi> or by <hi>Imputation.</hi> But the merits of Jesus Christ are not <hi>inherent</hi> in us; therefore if they be our righteousness in the sight of God, they must be <hi>imputed</hi> to us. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more plain than that, if we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by the righteousness of another, <hi>viz.</hi> of Christ, we are justified by a righteousness <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> and not <hi>inherent;</hi> and consequently that there is such a thing as <hi>imputed righteousness,</hi> else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where than in the fancies of men. Sure I am, The merits of Christ can avail us nothing, unless they be imputed, or reckoned to us; or unless God, upon the account thereof (and not of our own internal holiness) do deal with us, as if we in, and of our selves had been worthy of eternal life, Christ's meriting had signified nothing to us, unless he had merited for us, or with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention that his merits should be put to our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; as Christ's giving up himself to death, had been of no use to us, unless he had loved us, and given himself for us. If Christ's merit be not imputed to us, for the accepting of us righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before God, we have no advantage by it any more than a man can have had by a plaister that was never applyed. Now they that say we are justified only for the merit of Christ (or for the righteousness of Christ imputed, which hath been prov'd to come all to one,) as saith the <hi>Article</hi> of our Church, do vastly differ from Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> that saith we are not justified, no not partly, by <hi>Imputed Righteousness;</hi> yea indeed, that there is no such thing. If his evasion should be that Christ hath merited that our sincere obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:212643:95"/> and God's acceptance thereof, instead of that which is compleat and perfect, should be the <hi>matter,</hi> and <hi>form</hi> of our justification, or righteousness before God (which is like the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists notion, <hi>viz.</hi> that works dyed in the blood of Christ do justifie) I say, such a notion as that is very unsound and unsafe. For that were to make as if Christ did give away the glory of Justification, and Salvation to another, <hi>viz.</hi> to our <hi>Gospel obedience;</hi> and died not to save us himself, but make us Saviours to our selves: or had said to <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Good Works,</hi> as <hi>Joab</hi> did to <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.27. <hi>I have fought against Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bab, and have taken the City of Waters. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore encamp thou against the City and take it, lest I take the City, and it be called after my name.</hi> i. e. he had as good as done the work, but he would have <hi>David</hi> have the honor of it. To say that Christ merited that we might merit; (or be counted worthy of eternal life upon account of our own inherent righteousness, which is all one) is to say that Christ who merited that we should be saved by his <hi>Grace,</hi> merited that we should be saved by our own works, which is a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to reason, and a turning the Covenant of Grace into a Covenant of Works. To say that Christ hath merited that our sincere, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect obedience to the Gospel should be the righteousness whereby we are counted savingly righteous before God; is, 1. To attribute the Pardon of our sins to our own good works, (for by what we are justified, by that we are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; or by that righteousness our sins are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered)
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:212643:95"/> now that cannot be, for our less than due obedience cannot satisfie God for our disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Or, 2. It were to make as if the imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or imputation of Christ's righteousness to Believers, would not have been sufficient for their Justification, unless that imputed Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness were caked out for that purpose by our good works, as our good works had not been sufficient if they had not been taked out with the righteousness of Christ. Now who dares to think that for God to have reckoned what Christ had done and suffered, as Mediator, to have been done and suffered for us, and in our behalf, had not been sufficient to have freed us from hell, and entitled us to eternal life? And if that alone be sufficient, why should we think that God hath added <hi>Gospel Obedience</hi> as a Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with Christ in the justification of a sinner; or that we are justified partly by Christ's passive, and partly by our own active obedience? They that shall venture between those two stools will fall to the ground. Far be it from us to think that Christ hath died to make a Saviour of any thing, or of any body but himself. If God need do no more than reckon to us the satisfaction made to his Law, and Justice, by Christ our <hi>Surety,</hi> as if we had made it our selves, in order to his making us happy (with consistence to all his Attributes) why should we think that God doth call in the assistance of <hi>Inherent Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> for, and towards the justifying of a sinner? <hi>Frustra fit per plura.</hi> He that saith, <hi>If there had been a Law that could have given Righteousness,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:212643:96"/> verily Righteousness should have been by that Law.</hi> Would he not say that the Righteousness of Christ imputed being alone sufficient for the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification of a sinner, verily he shall be justified by that righteousness alone. <hi>Internal</hi> Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is good for many other excellent purposes, though not to be the matter of our Justifying righteousness before God; as Gold and Silver are good for many things, though not to eat. Upon the whole matter I find Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> (and as many more as are of his mind) highly peccant against the 11th <hi>Article</hi> of our Church, as to the first Proposition the ein contained; <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>only for the merit of our Lord, and Saviour Christ, we are accepted righteous before God.</hi> Concerning which Mr. <hi>Rogers (the then Arch Bishops Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi> and explainer of the Articles by Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) addeth, <hi>And this is the Faith, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of all the Churches Reformed</hi> The 2d Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position contained in the 11th Article, according to Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> his division of it, is this, <hi>Only by Faith are we accounted righteous before God.</hi> This branch of the Article seems to hold forth how, and by what means we become interessed in the merit of Christ, for which alone we are count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed righteous before God, <hi>viz</hi> by <hi>Faith.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> contradicteth that first Assertion two ways: 1. By saying in effect that we are justified as truly, and as much, by <hi>Repentance, Love,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very other Grace, as by <hi>Faith.</hi> For he makes <hi>Faith</hi> to be the Sum, and Substance of all Graces, as if every grace were <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> were all graces in one. 2. By saying that we are
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:212643:96"/> justified or accounted righteous before God not only by <hi>Faith,</hi> but also by <hi>Good Works,</hi> which he calls <hi>Faith,</hi> or the <hi>Righteousness of Faith,</hi> witness, <hi>Sh.</hi> p. 273. where he saith, <hi>That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Holiness,</hi> which they call the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Law, is that very righteousness of <hi>Faith</hi> which the Gospel commands. Now that Internal Holiness, <hi>he calls a conformity of heart and life to the Moral Precepts,</hi> which making to be the same thing with <hi>Faith,</hi> he strongly confounds <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Good Works,</hi> and makes them both one. In so doing he contradicteth the third Proposition contained in the Article which I am speaking of; <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>we are count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed righteous before God not for our own works, or deservings.</hi> In which words there is a manifest opposition made betwixt <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Good Works,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Sh</hi> would have us take for one and the same thing. He makes as if <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Good Works</hi> are all one, and so brings in Works into Justification; whereas the Article not only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisheth, but opposeth them, and so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes <hi>Works</hi> from Justification. He that with reference to what hath been objected, can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile Mr. <hi>Sh</hi>'s. Tenets of Justification to the 11th <hi>Article</hi> of our Church, <hi>erit mihi Magnus Apollo.</hi> Now that the World may be sure that I have not mistaken the sense and meaning of the Church in this their 11th <hi>Article,</hi> I appeal to the <hi>Homilies</hi> before cited; and who knows not that the Homilies are the most genuine, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Comment upon the Articles? (as the Prophets of the Old Testament were upon the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:212643:97"/> five Books of <hi>Moses.</hi>) and doubtless as the <hi>Homilies</hi> have stated the Doctrine of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; so the Article intended it. And therefore whosoever contradicts the <hi>Homilies</hi> in the point of Justification (as Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> has done abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) must contradict the <hi>Articles</hi> also. After all this, I can hardly forbear to put forth such a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> as <hi>Dalilah</hi> did to <hi>Sampson, Now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound?</hi> Judg. 15.10.

               <p>Considering how great, and manifold an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est the righteousness of Christ, which can be ours only by <hi>Imputation,</hi> has been proved to have in the business of justifying a sinner before God, their <hi>error, sin,</hi> and <hi>presumption</hi> must needs be great, who set themselves to oppose that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and the imputation of it. For it hath been proved that the Righteousness of Christ, is the <hi>material cause</hi> of our Justification, or the <hi>matter</hi> of our Righteousness before God; or that Righteousness by which, and with which, and upon the account of which believers are justified in God's sight. Also, that the Righteousness of Christ is the <hi>Meritorious cause</hi> of our Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or that Righteousness for which, or for the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:212643:97"/> sake of which, and by the merit and desert of which, Believers have their sins pardoned, and are accepted righteous to eternal life. It hath also been proved that the Righteousness of Christ is the <hi>Formal cause</hi> of Justification, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as <hi>imputed,</hi> or that the <hi>imputation</hi> of Christ his Righteousness is so; not that Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are <hi>formally</hi> righteous with the righteousness of Christ, as a wise man is formally wise by his inherent wisdome; but for that they are as effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually saved from Hell, and accepted to eternal life upon account of what Christ hath done, and suffered for them, (which I call his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness) as if they had a perfect compleat Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness inherent in themselves (whereby they were formally righteous to the strictest sense) with which to appear before God. I have also proved the Righteousness of Christ to be the great <hi>Object</hi> of that Faith which has been said to be the <hi>Instrumental</hi> cause of Justification, and that Faith is said to justifie us only <hi>correlatively</hi> unto Christ Crucified, Christ fulfilling all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness for us, whose righteousness is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, accepted, and applyed by Faith alone. That the righteousness of Christ is also the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catarctical</hi> cause of our Justification, or the great cause which doth move God, <hi>ab extra</hi> (or from without himself) in opposition to the <hi>proegume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> or inwardly moving cause, <hi>viz.</hi> the Love, and good Will of God) to justifie sinners; For thereunto is God moved by what Jesus Christ hath done, and suffered for them. <hi>Forgiving one another (saith the Apostle) even as God for
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:212643:98"/> Christ's sake hath forgiven you,</hi> Eph. 4.32. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, From what hath been said may also be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered that the exalting, or magnifying of the righteousness of Jesus Christ, or that the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite sufficiency, worth, and dignity of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and Satisfaction of Christ, and that the infinite Love and Mercy of God in providing such a Sacrifice, and such a righteousness for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, might be made known to the World.

               </p>
               <p>The righteousness of Christ being thus upon the matter all in all, in the business of <hi>Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> not only the <hi>material,</hi> but the <hi>formal,</hi> the <hi>Procatarctical,</hi> the <hi>meritorious,</hi> the <hi>Final</hi> cause of Justification (under several notions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations) it will follow that they who deny <hi>Imputed</hi> righteousness, and consequently the righteousness of Christ, which is thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, do lay the Ax of their Error, to the very root of the Doctrine of <hi>Justification</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most the greatest Doctrine in all Christianity) and do threaten to cut it down, both Root and Branch. For take away the <hi>Material, Formal, Meritorious, Procatarctical, Final,</hi> and <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> causes of Justification (for if the <hi>object</hi> of Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> the righteousness of Christ be taken away, the <hi>Act</hi> must needs cease; and so <hi>Faith,</hi> the <hi>Instrument</hi> of Justification, must fall to the ground.) I say, take away all these causes
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:212643:98"/> of <hi>Justification,</hi> and what will remain? Scarce so much as were the remains of <hi>Jezebel, whom when they went to bury,</hi> 2 King. 9.35. <hi>they sound no more of her than the skul and the feet, and the palms of her hands, so that</hi> (as it was Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied by <hi>Elijah) they shall not say this is</hi> Jezebel; that is, they should not know her to be the same; or to allude to what is said of <hi>Dagon,</hi> in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.4. <hi>And the Head of</hi> Dagon, <hi>and both the palms of his Hands were cut off upon the Threshold, only the stump of</hi> Dagon <hi>was left to him.</hi> So the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers of Christ's imputed righteousness do leave scarce so much as a stump of the Doctrine of Justification.</p>
               <p>And as it was said of <hi>Dagon,</hi> that he was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len upon his Face to the ground, so the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries of <hi>Imputed</hi> righteousness have laid the Doctrine of Justification flat upon its face, (as it were) so that according to them we cannot know it to be what it is, or say, <hi>This is justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> The righteousness whereby we are <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified,</hi> and wherewith we are <hi>sanctified</hi> are so confounded, and made one and the same, the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> and the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> made so like each other, as to differ but in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; one exacting a perfect, the other accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an imperfect, sincere Obedience for our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving righteousness before God, <hi>Protestant,</hi> and <hi>Popish</hi> Doctrine so blended, or rather <hi>Protestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> (or what is so called) so conform'd to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pery,</hi> so many of the main causes of <hi>Just fication</hi> destroy'd at once; Justification so dwindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to almost nothing to what had wont to be

               <p>One good way to be established in the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of Christ's imputed righteousness, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from the damnable errors aforesaid (for so I must call them) is to take heed how we deny the <hi>Imputation,</hi> or at leastwise the <hi>Infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion</hi> and <hi>Inherency</hi> of <hi>Original sin.</hi> Be establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the belief of imputed sin, and you will never stagger at the Doctrine of <hi>Imputed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</hi> For who ever did deny the latter who did not first doubt the former? Now, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or pollution of our Natures by Original Sin, me thinks is evident from this Argument, and Consideration amongst others. If we were not born in sin, and Conceived in Iniquity, we should have an indifferency to good or evil, no more propension to evil than to good, we should be as ductile, and pliable to what is good, as to what is evil, consequently, as we had more incentives from without, more inducements, more advantages, more helps and conduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to one than to the other, we should close with that, whether good, or evil. As a man that walks abroad for his pleasure, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly indifferent which way he walks, East, or West; let a Friend come and desire him to go
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:212643:99"/> with him Eastward or Westward, that way that he desires him to go with him he will go, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause before he was perfectly indifferent which way he went. He was like a pair of Scales han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in <hi>aequilibrio,</hi> in an equipoise, if but a grain or two be cast into either of them presently that Scale is turned; I say, the Scale is presently turned on that side, because before they were just even. So would it be with Men were they like to two even Scales, as to good and evil, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which did in the least preponderate (as they would Naturally be if their were no pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Original Sin) the least grain, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of reason, and of inducement cast in on either side would cause the Scale to turn on that side, had they ever so little more of Example, Counsel, Encouragement, Interest, or other Inducement to be, and to do good, than to be, and to do evil; they would certainly be, and do that which were good. But woful Experience tells us that it often proves quite otherwise. For how many Children have we seen and known, whose Parents from their very Child-hood have taken all possible care to ingage them in, and for the wayes of God, setting excellent Example before them, and suffering them to see no other, giving them the best Counsel they could, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them what was good, and what was not; the ugliness and danger of sin, the beauty and profitableness of Holiness, threatning and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying them in case they did amiss; yea, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of them now, and then, incouraging them by large promises if they did well, and by
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:212643:100"/> frequent great rewards as oft as they found them well doing, giving them the best books to read, the best Company to keep, watching over them continually; and yet after all this, those Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or some of them, have betaken themselvs to ill courses, and run into all excess of riot, though Parents have done all that ever they could to keep down the Weeds of Sin, and to sow and cherish the Seeds of Virtue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in them from time to time. If such Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren had not been Naturally propense to evil, and averse to good, or propense to evil, and not to good, upon all those helps and advantages un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to being good, they certainly have prov'd so: It was therefore doubtless the Corruption of their Natures (otherwise caller <hi>Original</hi> sin) which made them break all those bonds, and cast all those Cords from them, which would otherwise have held them to the performance of their Duty, and unto keeping Consciences void of offence towards God and Men. Never tell me that any man hath as much mind to do one thing as another, when a hundred times so much perswasion cannot prevail upon him to do the one, as will prevail upon him to do the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When Scales are even, a few grains ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to either of them, will cause that side to turn, and to weigh down: but where it is so that many <hi>Ounces,</hi> and <hi>Pounds</hi> will not cause one of the Scales to out-weigh the other, 'tis most certain they are not even, but one Scale doth much preponderate the other. Where ground is plain and level, the way backward
<pb n="795" facs="tcp:212643:100"/> and forward are both alike easie, but when it is hard to go, and easie to come back, is a sign the ground is Hilly and uneven. Finding therefore that the doing of good is to men Naturally dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and uneasie like going up a steep Hill, and that to do evil is easie to men, like coming down the Hill; 'tis manifest that the Nature of man is not indifferent to good and evil, but averse to good, and propense to evil. When Men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to deny a thing so evident in the sight of Experience, as is the pollution of our Natures by Original sin, because they cannot satisfie themselves touching the way and manner how it it is conveyed (as if men should deny that the River <hi>Nilus</hi> ever had any streams, or that there was ever such a River, because they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find out it's Head) no wonder if they make bold also to deny what they never saw, and felt (as they love done the other) <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Imputed</hi> Righteousness of Jesus Christ. On the other hand, whosoever is duly sensible of the great pollution of his <hi>Nature,</hi> as well as of his <hi>Life,</hi> and of Original depravation as well as of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement by actual sins, will cry out for the Robe of Christ's Imputed Righteousness to cover his manifold defects and deformities, and never dare to trust to such filthy rags as he finds his own Righteousness to be.</p>

               <p>'Tis vehemently to be suspected that some men have made so much the higher pretences unto being justified by their own Righteousness because they knew they had no Righteousness of their own whereby to be Justified; so that their so doing was but a meer cloak, colour, and covert for their unrighteousness: as who should say, No man will suspect us to be unrighteous, or ungodly (though we know our selves so to

Rom.</hi> 9.33. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2, 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. <hi>But Israel, which followed after the Law of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, hath not attained to the Law of righteousness.

Because they sought it not by Faith, but as it were by the works of the Law; for they stumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at that stumbling stone,</hi> (viz. <hi>at Christ, and at the way of Justification, and Salvation by him.)

            <p n="1">1. If Jesus Christ be a <hi>Person</hi> then we ought to be acquainted with his <hi>Person</hi> (for we ought to acquaint our selves with what Christ is, so far as possibly we can.)

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:212643:107"/> according to you, in all the Bible, <hi>viz. A Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son invested with an Office,</hi> p. 8.

            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Arg.</hi> We ought to know Christ as <hi>Man,</hi> or the Man <hi>Christ Jesus.</hi> Now Christ as <hi>Man</hi> is a Person, for his Humane Nature is taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to oneness of subsistence, or of Personality with the Divine Nature, which is called the <hi>Hypostatical Ʋnion.</hi>

            <p>Surely I need say no more (nay have said more than I did need) to convince any man that he has done very sinfully in disowning, and deriding so real, and sacred a thing, as is <hi>Acquaintance with the Person of Christ,</hi> though under pretence of zeal for his Law and Gospel. Now whereas I find these two words, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> &amp; <hi>Gospel</hi> of our Saviour often put together in Mr. <hi>Sh</hi>'s. book, as if the latter did signifie more than the former, give me leave to observe by the way, that one of them might be spared: for they are one and the same in sense, and significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for that the <hi>Gospel</hi> of Christ is his <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> of Christ is his <hi>Gospel:</hi> For the Gospel of Christ is not all made up of <hi>Promises,</hi> but partly of <hi>Precepts.</hi> Was it not the sum and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> or <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silus</hi> answered to the Jailor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.30. who asked them, <hi>Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</hi> v. 31. <hi>Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.</hi> The <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> as well as other Covenants, is <hi>Promissum sub condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,</hi>

               </gap> if I do not overlook great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er faults than <hi>Tantokgies</hi> in the Book that I am dealing with, I think I shall never have done with it.

            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Acquaintence with the person of our Saviour is to be desired in order to enkindling,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:212643:110"/> and encreasing Love and Affection in us towards him. <hi>Ignoti nulla Cupido.</hi> We may love Christ though we never saw him, but we cannot love him if we never knew him. <hi>Thy name is as Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment poured forth,</hi> Cant. 1.3. <hi>therefore do the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins love thee;</hi> implying, that if the name of Christ had been as ointment close shut up in a Box, and not discovering it self, either by sight, or savour, they could not have loved him. When Ointments send forth their savour, we know what they are. Now saith the Text, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the savour of thy good Oin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ment therefore do they love thee,</hi> Cant. 1.3. As they say <hi>There is nothing in the understanding that was not first in the senses:</hi> it is as true, <hi>There is nothing in the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that was not first in the understanding.</hi> If then we ought to love the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eason of Christ, for certain we ought to acquaint our selves with his Person, and not with his Gospel only, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with that part of his Gospel only, which makes no mention of his Person. Who dares to say that the Person of Christ ought not to be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted</hi> in, yea that it is nor a great duty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light our selves in the <hi>Person,</hi> and Personal excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of our Saviour? If so I am sure we ought to be acquainted therewithal; for to delight in that whereof we are perfectly ignorant, is utterly impossible.</p>
            <p>Delighting, and rejoycing are neer akin: they seem to differ but in degree. Now that it is a duty to rejoyce in Christ Jesus may be gathered from sundry texts, <hi>viz. Phil.</hi> 3.1, 3. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord always, and again I say re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce:
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:212643:111"/> viz.</hi> in the Lord Christ; for that <hi>he</hi> is meant may, be collected from the next verse, <hi>viz. The Lord is at hand.</hi> But how can we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in one we know not, or with whom we have no acquaintance? <hi>In whom believing</hi> (saith the Scripture) <hi>we rejoyce:</hi> intimating that we could not rejoyce in Christ unless we knew him. For, saith the Apostle, <hi>How shall they believe on him of whom they have not heard?</hi> Whose doubt is it whether it be our duty and excellency to set a high <hi>price,</hi> and <hi>value</hi> upon Christ? Is it not said that <hi>to them that believ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Christ is precious?</hi> Yea, is it not as distinguishing a Character of a true Believer as can be given, that he is one that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lueth Jesus Christ above all the world, even then when he has fair opportunities to enjoy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of the World, and great probability that he may long continue so to do? Is not the <hi>Merchant man</hi> spoken of <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.45. <hi>Who when he had found one Pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it,</hi> an emblem of every true Christian setting forth the high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem, and value for Christ, which every such person hath? If so, It must needs be a great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to be endowed with power from on high to prefer Jesus Christ above our greatest joys, and enjoyments in this world. Now that we can never do unless we be acquainted with him. We can value no man till we know him, and his worth. To one that knows the worth of a barly corn, but not of a Jewel; a Jewel may seem less worth than a barly-corn. The Daughters of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> hearing the Church say that <hi>she was sick
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:212643:111"/> of Love,</hi> to Christ, made answer, <hi>What is thy Beloved more than another Beloved?</hi> But the Spouse that was acquainted with the Person of Christ, replyed; <hi>My Beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest amongst ten thousand,</hi> and so continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to commend him to the end of that Chapter. Whence did that prizing and admiring of the Person of Christ result but from her having that Acquaintance with him which others had not? (who were ready through their Ignorance to say, <hi>He hath no Form, nor Comliness, there is no Beauty that we should desire him.</hi>) Christ <hi>to the Jews</hi> that knew him not was a <hi>stumbling block, and to the Gentiles foolishness, but unto them which were called,</hi> (viz. to the saving knowledge of himself) <hi>Christ the Power of God and the Wisdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Fourth Priviledge resulting from our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ is, that thereby we shall be induced, and I had almost said inforced to trust him; For they that know Christ as they ought to know him cannot chuse but trust him. As there are some Truths which the mind of a man cannot chuse but assent to, at the first hearing, which do <hi>Cogere Assensum,</hi> so there are, some such indisputable objects of Love, and Trust, that they who know them to be what they are cannot but Love, and trust them. Such a one is Christ. <hi>They that know thy Name will trust in thee.</hi> Now, not the Word and Promises, but the Person of Christ is the <hi>first</hi> Object of our trust, and the <hi>reason</hi> of our trust: for what is the reason that we trust any mans word, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:212643:112"/> we know himself to be honest, and able to make it good? Who regards the Promise of a meer Stranger, not knowing who is, or as they say, whence he comes, and whether he will? <hi>Paul</hi> therefore trusted Christ with the invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Jewel of his Soul, because he was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. For, saith he, <hi>I know whom I have believed, and am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that he is able to keep that which I have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him against that day.</hi> Who would lose the benefit of being able chearfully to commit his Soul into the hands of Christ, for all Eternity, to excuse the Labour, and pains of being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him? Or what wise man would intrust any matter of great concernment in the hands of one whom he has no knowledge?</p>
            <p>To pass on to a <hi>Fifth.</hi> Is it no Priviledge that by how much more we know the Person, and Personal Excellencies of Christ, by so much more shall we know how to <hi>please,</hi> and <hi>imitate</hi> him? We cannot but please Christ when we imitate, and conform to him. Now, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ is a <hi>conforming,</hi> or rather <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming</hi> knowledge, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>We all with open face, as in a Glass beholding the Glory of God, are changed into the same Image.</hi> If we see Christ as he is, we cannot but be like him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. A full Vision of Christ will fully assimulate us to him, and so will a more imperfect Vision, or knowledge of him, in a degree. The more we know the temper, and disposition of any Friend, the better we know how to suit and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate our selves to him, and how to give
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:212643:112"/> him content. 'Tis both our Duty and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to conform to the will and Pattern of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>to walk as he walked; and to be in the world as he was in the World,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.17. and that we can never do, unless we know who he was, and how he behav'd himself when he was in this World. He that would <hi>learn of Christ</hi> (as he bids us) <hi>to be meek and Lowly,</hi> must first be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Christ as such, or know assuredly that he was so.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, By acquaintance with the Person of Christ, or with Christ himself (which you have told us comes all to one) we may come to know the <hi>Image of Christ,</hi> where, and in whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever we shall see it, and thereby be induced to love, and honour both it, and them. St. <hi>John</hi> did find it a great advantage to himself and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that they did know and love the <hi>Image</hi> of Christ where they saw it. For, saith he, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.14. <hi>We know that we have passed from Death to Life, because we love the Brethren,</hi> meaning, such in whom the Image, and likeness of Christ did appear. Who can Love and value a <hi>Copy</hi> for it's likeness to the <hi>Original,</hi> unless he be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Original to which it is like? If one man imitate another as exactly as he can, in Preaching, or otherwise, who can love him for so doing, unless he know, and prize the Person whom he imitates?</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Mr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> himself seems to account it a great Duty, and Priviledge, to be acquainted with the <hi>Gospel</hi> of Christ. Now, who knows not that it is impossible to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:212643:113"/> with the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ, and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of his <hi>Person, viz. Life, Death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,</hi> &amp;c. and not to be acquainted with a great part of his <hi>Gospel,</hi> sith a great part of the <hi>Gospel</hi> is taken up in describing to us who Christ was, what he did, and suffered; and for what ends, and purposes he did and suffered such things?</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Yea, more than so, Acquaintance with the Person of Christ doth not only imply, and involve acquaintance with a great part of his <hi>Gospel,</hi> but hath also a great tendency and influence both to <hi>awe,</hi> and <hi>allure</hi> us to the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereof. The knowledge of Christ as the Judge of Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ick, and Dead, who will one day <hi>come in flames of Fire to take Vengeance on them who obey not his Gospel,</hi> may awe us into O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as the Apostle speaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Knowing therefore the terrour of the Lord, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade men.</hi> He had said in the verse immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fore going, <hi>For we must all appear before the Judgment-seat of Christ,</hi> &amp;c And sith <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Majesty</hi> do both meet in Christ, and greet each other, surely there is much in that knowledge of his <hi>Person,</hi> as well to <hi>invite,</hi> and allure, as to <hi>awe,</hi> and affright us into the Obedience of his <hi>Gospel.</hi> Else what meaneth that obtestation of the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. <hi>I beseech you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Some said he hath the <hi>Body,</hi> but not the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man; others, that he took an <hi>Ethereal,</hi> or Spiritual, not a true Body, and such like. They are seconded at this day by <hi>Antitrinitarians, Familists, Socinians,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>An effectual Antidote against <hi>Quakerism</hi> is, I think, as necessary at this day as such an one against the <hi>Plague</hi> would have been some years since: and certainly a due Acquaintance with the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ, and stedfast belief of what the Scripture saith concerning the <hi>Person</hi> of our Saviour, is as Sovereign an Antidote against the Pestilent Doctrines of the <hi>Quakers</hi> as can be made use of. For who can be a <hi>Quaker</hi> (truly so called) who doth really believe what the Scripture hath revealed to us, as touching the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ? As namely, that Jesus Christ is not a meer <hi>Quality, Accident, or Principle,</hi> or nothing else but <hi>the Light</hi> which is <hi>within</hi> every man, but a <hi>real Person,</hi> true God, and true Man, and that the Gospel is a real <hi>History,</hi> and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:212643:114"/> true matter of Fact in the Letter of it, as well as a profound <hi>Mystery,</hi> with reference to the wise contrivance, and Excellent designs, and uses thereof? The <hi>Quakers</hi> (like the <hi>Famelists</hi> of old) turn the whole <hi>History</hi> of the Gospel, so far as concerns the Person of Christ into an <hi>Allegory,</hi> and by endeavouring to make nothing but a meer <hi>Figure</hi> of it, do make it a meer <hi>Cypher.</hi> Before I go any further I must take leave to tell Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> that the course he takes is the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to <hi>Quakerism.</hi> For if men shall be derided for making mention of the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ, and wheresoever the name of Christ is found we shall generally be directed to understand thereby either the <hi>Church,</hi> or certain <hi>Laws and Rules,</hi> or above and before all, a certain Office (one, or more) how soon may the subtiler sort of Quakers tell us that there is but a step betwixt us and them, they can easily give us the Right hand of fellowship? They say that the <hi>Light</hi> of Nature, or Light within us (which is a great Law, or System of Laws) that is Christ. They say that <hi>Conscience</hi> (that great <hi>Office,</hi> and Court of Judicature set up in every mans breast) that is <hi>Christ,</hi> and we (if of Mr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s mind) do say that <hi>Christ</hi> is primarily, and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally the name of an Office. They say that Christ and we are all one, for every man is one and the same with the Light that is in him (for that Light is something of our selves: and we say that Christ for the most part signifies either the Church, whereof our selves are a part, or certain Laws and Rules of Life, and such is the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:212643:114"/> Light within us, or is the name of an Office, and has not the Light within us several Offices, as namely to accuse, or excuse; to condemn, or acquit, and comfort us, as the matter shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus whilst every thing almost that is said of Christ himself, we do interpret to belong to his <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel,</hi> and do generally read the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter instead of the former (as if it were so in our Bibles) we shall be apt to forget that there is any such <hi>Person,</hi> as Christ, and what that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son has done and suffered for us, and be in a great preparedness to comply with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who retain in effect nothing but the name of Christ, by which name they baptize, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend nothing but the <hi>Light within them,</hi> or the <hi>Law</hi> of Nature. Could the grosser sort of <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> but extirpate the History and Doctrine of the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ, and bury them in perfect oblivion: I doubt not but they would think the greatest part of their work were done, and then the Light of Nature might easily be set upon the Throne of Christ, and be generally accepted for the only Light that men should turn to.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, <hi>Fellowship and Converse</hi> with Jesus Christ is doubtless a great priviledge, for so St. <hi>John</hi> speaks of it, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.3. and there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion to be made but that Communion and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with Christ is, and may be much facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, and farthered, by our Acquaintance with his Person. We scarce know how to converse with those to whom we are yet but strangers; we hardly know what is fit and proper for us to
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:212643:115"/> say to them, or how to take and construe such things as they speak to us; whether they speak as they think, or only to trye us, or whether they take in good part what we say to them. But when we discourse those persons with whom we are intimately acquainted, we have as it were a Key to all they say; we easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand their meaning if they say but a little, and can apply our selves to them with freedom and confidence. They who are well acquainted with dumb persons, can understand their very <hi>signs,</hi> and motions, better it may be, than the articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar words, and expressions of those whom they never saw before.</p>
            <p>Again, Acquaintance with the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ is as it were a door, an inlet to all sorts of Graces, as namely, <hi>Faith, Love, Humility, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Self-denyal, Patience,</hi> and what not? Faith in Christ is called <hi>Knowledge,</hi> Isa. 53.11. <hi>By the knowledge of him shall he justifie many,</hi> and so elsewhere, probably because it is introduced by, and founded in the knowledge of Christ. Of <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> in Christ, springing from thence I spake before. To prove it will teach us <hi>Humility,</hi> I might alledge what <hi>Job</hi> saith to God <hi>Now mine eyes have seen thee, therefore do I abhor my self in</hi> dust and ashes: also those words of Christ, <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly.</hi> If the knowledg of Christ doth not promote <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> why is it said, <hi>They shall see him whom they have pierced, and mourn over him?</hi> To know Christ to have been <hi>oppressed and afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth, as a sheep before the shearers
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:212643:115"/> is dumb,</hi> &amp;c. Isa. 58.7. <hi>Who when he was revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, reviled not again, when he suffered he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.23. Is it not a great Instance and lesson of <hi>Patience?</hi> when the Apostle saith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.5 6. <hi>Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, made himself of no Reputation, and took upon him th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> form of a Servant, and became obedient, even to the Death of the Cross;</hi> do's he not set before us the highest Example of <hi>Self-denyal</hi> that ever was? The like might be said of all other graces how they may be learnt by a due Acquaintance with Christ. Take one or two Texts for all, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Grace and Peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God, and of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</hi> What more full Expression than that of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is Life Eternal, that they might know thee and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</hi> Intimating that a right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and Christ, is <hi>seminally, virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi> and <hi>radically,</hi> all Grace, and all that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in order to Glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, do all these great benefits and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges result from a right knowledge of the Person of Christ, and dare any man be so bold (I had almost said so desperate) as to laugh it to scorn? But Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> tells us, p. 57. of a very bad scheme of Divinity (as he counts it) drawn from the Doctrine of Acquaintance with the Person of Christ, of which in his jearing Language he saith, <hi>These are those great Gospel Mysteries, and Soul saving Truths which are learnt from an Acquaintance with Christ's Person, which his
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:212643:116"/> Gospel is silent in.</hi> But how inconsistent is he with himself? For he has no sooner ended that <hi>mock scheme,</hi> which he puts upon those whom he writes against, but he forthwith gives you another of his own, as sound (to his thinking) as sound can be, which he saith, <hi>is much more plainly deducible from an Acquaintance with Christ's Person,</hi> p. 81. How can that Doctrine be in it's self despicable, false, and dangerous, from whence a whole System, or Scheme of <hi>good Divinity</hi> may be drawn? St. <hi>James</hi> saith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.12. <hi>One Fountain cannot send forth salt waters and fresh.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> has brought first Salt Waters, as he counts them, and then fresh, and both out of the same Fountain, <hi>viz. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the Person of Christ.</hi> They had wont to say, <hi>Can any good come out of</hi> Nazareth? But with much more reason it may be said, Can a fansiful imaginary Doctrine, such as he often intimates that of Acquaintance with Christ's Person to be, yield so many great Truths, as Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> undertakes to infer from thence? for he saith, p. 87. <hi>All this we learn from an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Christ's Person (as these men call it)</hi> and then he adds (judge you how humbly) <hi>And it were easie now to draw the whole Plot and design of Christianity, to search into the deep coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of God, and to discover those Principles and Motives he was Acted by, and the Infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the contrivance and the true methods of a sinners recovery by Christ, and what that Homage and Worship is which we owe our Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if it be so, that all these great, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:212643:116"/> Truths Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> hath learnt, and could discover from <hi>Acquaintance with Christ's Person,</hi> adding <hi>(as they call it)</hi> never I think was a Doctrine so confessedly pregnant, and able in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentally to lead a man into all truth, <hi>even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the deep counsels of God, and the Infinite wisdom of his contrivances</hi> (as he phraseth it) so kickt, and spurn'd at, so scorn'd and derided, as <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Christ's Person</hi> has been by one that tells us he has learnt, and could discover so much from it. Admit some men should, or had drawn <hi>a bad Scheme of Theology,</hi> from a great, and wholsom truth (as foul stomacks corrupt the best of nourishments, and the very grace of God it's self is by some turned into wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nness) was it Lawful for Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> to expose that great Truth, to scorn, and contempt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause others had so perverted it? (as some are said to wrest some passages in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles, to their own destruction.) By the same reason might he not go about to raze the only Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> because some even upon that have <hi>built Hay and Stubble.</hi> Had not Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> prevented me by giving <hi>a Scheme of Divinity,</hi> of his own approving, deducible, as he tells us, from Acquaintance with Christ's Person, I could easily have given him another, such as I think he would not have offered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the Truth, and goodness, either of the whole, or of any part thereof. I would have premised but two or three things, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> by that <hi>Acquaintance with the Person of Christ,</hi> for pretending to which he derides those
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:212643:117"/> whom he writes against, understands acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the <hi>Circumstances,</hi> and <hi>adjuncts</hi> of the Person of Christ; as namely, with his <hi>Life, Death, Resurrection, Ascension, Intercession,</hi> as well as with himself immediately, for that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, not only from p. 139, and 140. (where he exposeth men for being so much transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted sometimes with the thoughts of <hi>Christ Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified</hi>) other whiles with the apprehension of his Love to them, but more especially from that <hi>Scheme of Divinity</hi> which himself deduceth from Acquaintance with Christs Person; beginning p. 81. and reaching to p. 87. where he first treats of Christ his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> or coming into the World in the Nature of Man. Then he treats of the <hi>good works,</hi> and kind <hi>Miracles</hi> which he wrought in the World. <hi>Then he mentions the World being made by Christ.</hi> Afterwards he <hi>speaks of the Innocence, and Holiness of his Life, of his Excellent Example.</hi> By and by, <hi>he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Christ his dying as a sacrifice for sin.</hi> Then he speaks of Christ his <hi>Resurrection from the dead,</hi> and <hi>his Ascension to Heaven,</hi> p. 86. <hi>Of his Exaltation to the right hand of God, and of his Intercession.</hi> All these things he refers to our <hi>Acquaintance with Christ</hi>'s <hi>Person,</hi> adding <hi>(as these men call it)</hi> nay, it is easie to shew that he doth also thereunto refer <hi>Acquaintance with the Divine,</hi> as well <hi>as Humane Nature of Christ, and with the several Excellencies, and perfections of both his Natures united in one Person.</hi> For v. 82. saith he, <hi>when we consider this Mediator was no less than the Eternal son of God, by whom the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:212643:117"/> Worlds were made;</hi> (which words he brings into his discourse of Christs <hi>Person,</hi> &amp;c.) Now if to be acquainted with Christs <hi>Person,</hi> be to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his <hi>Incarnation, Life,</hi> good <hi>Works, Death Resurrection, Ascension,</hi> and <hi>Intercession,</hi> yea with his <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and the several <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies</hi> and <hi>Perfections</hi> thereof, I dare be bold to say it were a very easie thing, from all of these put together, to deduce all the <hi>Articles of our Creed,</hi> the <hi>Doctrine of a Deity,</hi> and of <hi>a Trinity in Ʋnity,</hi> of the <hi>Divine Attributes,</hi> of <hi>Creation, Providence,</hi> and of all the <hi>great</hi> things which are revealed concerning Christ, as he was <hi>Man,</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and of the <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> (for knowing Christ to be Head of the Church, I must know there is a <hi>Church</hi> that hath Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion amongst the several Members of it, as members of the Natural Body have each with other) Moreover, the Doctrine of <hi>Forgiveness of sins,</hi> of the <hi>Resurrection of the Dead,</hi> and <hi>of the Life Everlasting:</hi> Yea, a man cannot have so much knowledge of the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ, but he must needs know the substance of <hi>the Ten Commandments,</hi> and that he ought to conform thereunto; for he that knows how Christ walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, knows that Christians ought to walk as they have had him for an example, who loved God with all his heart, and his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours (if men may so be called) as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>Now if <hi>Acquaintance with Christ his Person,</hi> according to that Description which Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> himself doth make of it, do take in so great a
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:212643:118"/> part of the most indisputable Divinity that we have; <hi>viz.</hi> the sum of the <hi>Creed,</hi> and <hi>Decalogue,</hi> who can but wonder at the extreme folly, and wickedness of any man, that should presume to write one line in contempt thereof? Had there been a generation of men who had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have known the <hi>bodily personage of Christ,</hi> his <hi>Stature, Complexion, Features,</hi> &amp;c. or to have had such a vision of Christ as <hi>Stephen, Acts</hi> 7.55. <hi>Who looking up to Heaven, saw Jesus sitting at the right hand of God,</hi> or to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed with the person of Christ face, to face (as some have pretended to have done with Angels) to have exposed such wild Enthusiasts as those, for their vain pretences, had been but to have serv'd them in their kind, and such a rod as you have made might have suited well enough with the backs of such fools: But to fall foul upon men for pretending, at leastwise to desire, and to press after those things which every good Christian ought to desire, and press after, and cannot do otherwise; <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>know Jesus</hi> Christ <hi>himself,</hi> and him <hi>Crucified,</hi> and rising again from the dead, yea to <hi>know the power of his death, and of his Resurrection,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. was so daring an attempt, and so malicious an enterprize, as I have seldom heard the like. Had the men you write against press'd their hearers, and readers to a meer <hi>speculative</hi> knowledg of Christ, only to fill their heads with <hi>notions</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature, and excellencies of Christ, you might have blam'd them for that: But 'tis an <hi>experimental</hi> knowledg of Christ, which you
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:212643:118"/> your self do confess, these men pretend, and press to, <hi>p.</hi> 139. for there you say, <hi>So these men talk also of an Experimental knowledge of Christ, the meaning of which is that this Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Person of Christ, warms and heats their fancies, sometimes they find great breakings of heart, &amp;c.</hi> The men you write against do press men so to know Christ, as to know him, is said, <hi>to be Life Eternal.</hi> They would be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood as Divines say the Scriptures should be, when they use words of knowledge, <hi>verba no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titiae connotant affectum,</hi> viz. to co-signifie suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able affections: They mind men of such Texts as those, 1 Joh. 2.3. <hi>Hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his Commandments:</hi> And v. 4. <hi>He that saith I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a lyar.</hi> And 1 Joh. 3.6. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.</hi> Now to abuse Reverend Ministers for pressing men to a practical, experimental, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate knowledge of the <hi>Incarnation, Life, Death, Resurrection, Ascension,</hi> and <hi>Intercession</hi> of Christ, and of his great <hi>Personal Excellencies,</hi> both <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane,</hi> was a thing so bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering upon <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> that hardly any thing can come nearer to it. There are two Errours more that I should be glad to convince Mr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi> of e're I conclude this Chapter; one is, that it was not <hi>Acquaintance with the Person of Christ</hi> that he should have expos'd more or less, (for that is a Sacred and most necessary thing) but he should have reproved the professed <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecters,</hi> and <hi>refusers</hi> of acquaintance with the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:212643:119"/>
               <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Gospel</hi> of Christ: He should have said, Here come they who say unto Christ, <hi>This man shall not Reign over us. Come, let us break his Bonds, and cast his Cords from us.</hi> Here come they who say unto God, <hi>Depart from us, we do not desire the knowledge of thy ways.</hi> You should have remembred, that <hi>Christ will come in flames of fire to take vengeance on them that know not God;</hi> and therefore should have found fault with them <hi>that obey not the Gospel of Christ,</hi> not with them who stir up themselves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to know Christ, yea his <hi>Person;</hi> for of that <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, when he saith, <hi>that I may know him, and the Power of his Death,</hi> &amp;c. You have plainly set the Saddle upon the wrong Horse, and must take more heed another time. Lastly, Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> hath built all his long Discourse about <hi>Acquaintance with the Person of Christ,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a false and sandy Foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> a meer Dream of his own; as if Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> did go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to set up a <hi>Religion of the Person of Christ</hi> in opposition to the <hi>Religion of his Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel;</hi> which I dare say never entered into his heart to do, nor can any such thing, with any colour of reason, be gathered from those two passages, viz. <hi>Sh. p.</hi> 38, and 39. from whence Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> commenceth two long Suits against Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> giving him in the first place this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronical Salute, <hi>I shall not envy the Author the glory of this Discovery, and therefore shall honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confess where I had it,</hi> viz. <hi>in a Book entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Communion with God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Written by</hi> John Owen, D. D. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="233" facs="tcp:212643:119"/>
            <p>Now they that shall impartially read those two passages quoted out of <hi>J. O.</hi> his Book of <hi>Communion with God,</hi> upon which Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth him with setting up a <hi>Religion of Christs Person,</hi> in opposition to the <hi>Religion of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> may easily see, that the <hi>Promises</hi> which Mr <hi>Sh.</hi> produceth, will by no means bear the <hi>Conclusion</hi> which he draws from thence, or prove Dr. <hi>O.</hi> guilty of any such Errour as he chargeth him with; but as the Proverb saith, <hi>There is a great deal of Cry, and but a little Wooll.</hi> The first passage in Dr. <hi>J. O's.</hi> Book, of which he makes so much use, is this: <hi>Christ is not only the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, but made Wisdom to us, not only by teaching us wisdome, as he is the great Prophet of the Church, but also because by the knowing of him we become acquainted with the wisdome of God, which is our wisdome.</hi> Thus far Dr. <hi>O.</hi> p. 87. Now what hurt in all this? At this great offence is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> but I see none given. That <hi>Christ is the wisdome of God,</hi> and not only so, but <hi>made to us of God wisdome,</hi> is the very expression of the Holy Ghost in Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. That Christ teacheth us Wisdom, as he is the great Prophet of the Church, is no Christians doubt. Therefore the only words that have raised all this clamour are these: <hi>but also because by the knowing of him we become acquainted with the Wisdome of God.</hi> Here Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> takes it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that by <hi>him</hi> is meant the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ, though the word Person is not once used in all this condemned passage: and though Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> himself when he finds the word <hi>Christ,</hi> doth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:212643:120"/> construe it to mean the <hi>Laws and Gospel of Christ,</hi> not his <hi>Person.</hi> Suppose we then that the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ was there intended by Dr. <hi>J. O.</hi> What false Divinity, or what bad sense is there, in saying, that by knowing the Person of Christ, we become acquainted with the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God? I am bold to say that Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ is one way to become acquainted with the Wisdome of God: and Dr. <hi>O.</hi> saith no more: for he saith, <hi>Christ is made Wisdome to us, not only by teaching us Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as he is the great Prophet, but also because by that knowing of him, we become to be acquainted with the Wisdome of God.</hi> Here Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> may note that Dr. <hi>O.</hi> owneth that <hi>Christ is made Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to us by teaching us Wisdome,</hi> that is, (as Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> himself expounds it) <hi>by the Doctrines he Preached, and those Revelations he hath made of God's will.</hi> How then doth Dr. <hi>O.</hi> exclude the Religion of Christ's <hi>Law and Gospel?</hi> or set Acquaintance with his <hi>Person,</hi> in opposition to Acquaintance with his Gospel? when you see he takes in both, in that single passage which you first quarrel with? Is this fair play, Sir? would you be so serv'd your self? At that rate a man may find fault with the most sound, and judicious book that ever was written, yea with a book (if there were any such) written by an holy Angel, and sent down from Heaven. But whereas you stumble at those words, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>by the knowing of Christ his Person, we become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Wisdome of God;</hi> to me they seem to be of easie, and safe interpretation. For
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:212643:120"/> first, I am perswaded that Christ executeth the Office of a <hi>Prophet,</hi> in revealing to us, not only by his <hi>Word,</hi> but also by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> the will of God for our Salvation. Now you seem to be of opinion that Christ revealeth his will to us only by his Word (For if by his <hi>Spirit</hi> also, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Acquaintance with the Person of Christ by procuring us a greater effusion of his spirit might increase our spiritual wisdome.) I know ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gentleman of your opinion (if that be it) he, and his followers, <hi>viz. Socinus Solut. scrup. Respons.</hi> 6. <hi>Sacrae Scripturae ita apertae, atque ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditae sunt, ut nemo eas qui non intelligat plane stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidus non videatur.</hi> Also <hi>Simon Episcopius, Disp.</hi> 46. <hi>priv. coral.</hi> 1. <hi>An ulla operatione Spiritus sancti sine ullo alio medio opus sit, in voluntate, aut intellectu, aut in Scripturis promittatur, ad hoc ut quis credat, verbo externo proposito? Nos Negati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam tuebimur.</hi> In plain <hi>English,</hi> the Tenet of the <hi>Socinians</hi> you know is, that God, and his will, may easily be known by meer reading of the Scripture, without any illumination from the Holy Ghost. You seem to be of the same mind, for that you reproach Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> for mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any other way whereby we may come ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Wisdome of God than by the Revelations which he hath made of his will in the Scripture. If that be true, why doth Christ say, <hi>John</hi> 14.26. <hi>The Holy Ghost whom the Father will send in my name shall teach you all things.</hi> We ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect not that the Spirit of God should reveal those things to us, which are no where revealed in the Scriptures: but that he should make us know
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:212643:121"/> those things more for our good, that he should help us to understand what otherwise we should not: therefore <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.18. <hi>Open thou mine eyes that I may see wonderous things out of thy Law. John</hi> 16.13. <hi>When the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into all Truth: for he shall not speak of himself (viz.</hi> any new Truths that Christ had not himself delivered) <hi>but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak.</hi> v. 14. <hi>He shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of mine, and shall shew it to you.</hi> And as the Spirit of God explaineth, so likewise he apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Truths to our hearts, <hi>which we</hi> our selves could not apply. <hi>He witnesseth with our Spirits that we are the Children of God, and cryeth in us, Abbah Father, and maketh us to know the things that are freely given us of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to come yet more close, why should Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> make so strange of this, that <hi>by knowing of the Person of Christ we should become more acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Wisdom of God?</hi> Is not <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3. pertinently quoted by Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> to confirm it, <hi>viz. For in him dwell all the Treasures of wisdom and knowledge?</hi> Let Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> disprove if he can, that those words do most directly refer to the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ. I have elsewhere shewed great probability for it. Now, to be acquainted with him in whom are all the Treasures of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is sure one good way to be wise. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially considering that it is his Office as Prophet of the Church to teach us, and <hi>his Lips are to preserve knowledge,</hi> and he is appointed of God to be to us wisdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But moreover the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Person</hi> of Christ is a most excellent Glass, in
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:212643:121"/> which to behold the wisdom, and all other the Attributes of God the Father, sith Christ is <hi>the express Image of his Father's Person, and the brightness of his glory.</hi> Did not Christ say to <hi>Philip,</hi> John 14.9. <hi>He that hath seen me hath seen the Father, and how sayest thou then, shew us the Father?</hi> That Text is also greatly to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>God hath shined in our hearts to give the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the Face of Jesus Christ.</hi> Let Mr <hi>Sh.</hi> deny then if he can, that knowing of Christ, is the way to more acquaintance with the Wisdom of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other passage in Dr. <hi>Owen's</hi> Book, <hi>Of Communion,</hi> p. 92. is this, <hi>Those properties of God (his pardoning Mercy,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>Christ hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in his Doctrine in that revelation which he had made of God and his Will, but the Life of this knowledge lies in Acquaintance with his Person, wherein the express Image, and beams of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Father doth shine forth.</hi> That is, that these things, <hi>are clearly, eminently, and savingly to be discover'd in Jesus Christ.</hi> I say, this is that other passage of Dr. <hi>Owen's,</hi> upon which Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> builds his Accusation, that Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth the <hi>Religion of Christ his Law and Gospel,</hi> and betaketh himself only to the <hi>Religion of Christ's Person,</hi> and to <hi>Acquaintance with his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi> But how injuriously, he that runs may read; for Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s words are, that <hi>The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi> (or Attributes) <hi>of God Christ hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in his Doctrine, in that Revelation which he hath made of God and his Will</hi> (that is, in the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:212643:122"/> Holy Scriptures) How then doth Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> reject Acpuaintance with the Gospel of Christ? Indeed he saith, that <hi>the Life of this knowledge lyes in Acquaintance with his Person, or that they are eminently, clearly, and savingly to be discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Jesus Christ.</hi> What Acquaintance with Christ is in Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s Divinity, Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> tells us, p. 38. <hi>viz. a knowledge what Christ is, hath done, and suffered for us;</hi> moreover, <hi>an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental knowledge of these things</hi> it is that Mr. Sh. saith, Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> and such as he, pretend unto, p. 139. Now as Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> hath explained him, I think Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> hath said very well, for what will it profit any man to have the <hi>Letter</hi> of the Scripture at his fingers ends, all by heart, as they say, yea, a competent knowledge of the sense and meaning thereof, if he have not that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> did profess himself to thirst after, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 10. viz. <hi>that he might know Christ, and the power of his Resurrection, and the Fellowship of his sufferings, being made confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to his death.</hi> Surely the Life of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is so to know Christ as to believe in him, to love, delight, trust in, obey, and study to please him, above all others, to know the power of his Death, and Resurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that is the knowledge Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> speaketh of, and who dare, in express terms, contradict that assertion? Upon the whole matter I find Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> had as little reason to quarrel Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> for what he hath written touching this matter as those two Brothers, of whom <hi>Camerarius</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his <hi>Horae subcisiva,</hi> had to quarrel, and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:212643:122"/> kill one another, which was but this. Walking out together in a brave Star light night, one of them, who was a <hi>Grasier,</hi> wisht that all the Firmament were one Rich Meadow, and his: the other being a <hi>Butcher,</hi> wisht that all the Stars in the Sky were so many large Oxen. The Grasier replyed, what would you do with your Oxen? Said the Butcher, I would put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Meadow; but you should not Brother, said the Grasier; yea, Brother, but I would, said the Butcher; and so they quarrelled (saith my Author) till they kill'd one another. I say, Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> in reference to what Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> hath said about our acquaintance with the Person of Christ, had no more cause to quarrel him, than the Grasier had his Brother the Butcher, for saying if all the Stars were Oxen he would put them in his Meadow (if all the Sky were that) and the other him for saying he should not. I wish Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> to consider, that as the <hi>Fall</hi> of Man came in at first by means of affecting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due knowledge, <hi>viz. to be like God, knowing good and Evil.</hi> So Man's Recovery is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be by means of that knowledge which is proper for him, according to that of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is Life Eternal, to know thee, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</hi> Let him therefore take heed how he derides that kind of knowledge which alone is saving.</p>
            <p>Let him also remember, that at that great day every body that can make the least pretence thereunto, will lay claim to Acquaintance with Jesus Christ (which he hath so much exposed)
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:212643:123"/> and that it had been better for any man never to have been born, than when he shall knock at Heaven Gate, to be answered, For what Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance knock you here? <hi>Depart, I know you not.</hi> In that day the <hi>Acquaintances of Jesus Christ,</hi> will appear to be the only happy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: and I dare say himself will wish, if he continue to despise them (as such) that he had rather cast in his lot amongst them. God grant that I may be ignorant of all things else, rather than of Jesus Christ, and him Crucified: For St. <hi>Paul determined to know</hi> (that is to make known) nothing else but that amongst the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. I shall conclude this Chapter with those words of the great Apostle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of the knowledg of Jesus Christ, my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung that I may win Christ.</hi>
